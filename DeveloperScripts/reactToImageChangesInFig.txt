> 'Why do I receive an error when I use IMPIXELINFO?'.
>
> You were receiving this error due to a bug in Image Processing Toolbox  
> 5.1 in the way the function IMPIXELINFO handles subplots.
>
> In order to workaround this issue, please do the following in MATLAB:
>
> 1. Type at the command line:
>
> cd([matlabroot,'\toolbox\images\imuitools\private'])
>
> This changes the current directory to  'private' directory in the path  
> mentioned above.
>
> 2. In this directory, save the M-file 'reactToImageChangesInFig.m' as  
> 'reactToImageChangesInFigOld.m'.
>
> 3. Save the attached M-file 'reactToImageChangesInFig.m' in the  
> directory above with the same name.
