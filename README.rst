CellProfiler is an open source microscopy library for the Python programming language. It features image classification and segmentation algorithms including support vector machines and random forests. CellProfiler inter-operates with Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

While CellProfiler is written in the Python programming language, some performance critical algorithms are written in Cython, a superset of the Python programming language with a foreign function interface for invoking C and C++ subroutines.

Installation
