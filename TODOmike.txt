Mike's TODO list

Make a pipeline for Lynne's wound healing assay.

****** Anne 1/7 - MANUSCRIPT FIGURES ******
WEDNESDAY>>>- You and I will image some cells to show the nice effects of our illumination correction on cell cycle distribution.

Change all lowercase figure labels a,b,c to A,B,C.
---

As of 1/7/06: Figure 2-a, left (Drosophila cell count)
- waiting for manual counts from Robert

As of 1/7/06: Figure 2-a, right (Human cell count)
- Waiting for manual cell counts from moms

Figure 2-d (G2/M separation)
- David chose fraction of cells to be the axis, and show pos and neg as the samples (rather than all). So that will be part one of this panel, for part 2 we hope we Will use jason's suggested mutant and see if we can see an increase in metaphase nuclei.

Figure 2-e (pH3 levels)
- We havenÕt even started this expt! We want to use Drosophila, since that is what this section covers. We can use phospho-H3 or phospho-S6 from the Fly200 experiment that is in In HanÕs database. Need to find an outlier gene that makes sense that should have increased or decreased staining. We can then show a histogram of staining intensity (probably mean, maybe integrated) for the two populations (control + the outlier)].

Figure 2-f: (localization)
- We decided to abandon pH3 and analyze the cyto/nuc Vitra plate: 4 positive and 4 negative control images. The figure should probably show one example image from pos and neg (showing just 2 or 3 cells each), plus a bar graph with error bars.

Figure 2-i (kiger hits quantified)
- We need to figure out if it will be feasible to find neat Kiger examples. We can use images from our kc genome-wide screen (or her original images).

Figure 3-a (DNA content histograms)
Still need to collect images and process...
As of 1/7/06: Human: DONE, but these changes still:
- Tell Anne how many images analyzed

Mouse:  no leads (Baltus rescinded permission, Ittai's and ShomitÕs didnÕt look so good due to focal plane issues) 
** Zebrafish - Sive lab?
** Xenopus - Sive lab?
** Planaria - Reddien lab? NOT GOOD
** plant cells??
** bacteria ??
* Drosophila S2 cells - we should have some from Fly200
* Maybe Yeast from Franco or guy that Mike emailed]

As of 1/7/06: Figure 3-b (Cell Cycle movies) 
- Tell me the scale bar sizes.

Anne 1/6: Please re-run the SBS images through, and add all the Measure modules: area & shape for nucleus (don't bother for cells, cytoplasm), and then intensity and texture for nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell, for both blue and green. I will explain why later > For the High throughput figure.

Anne 1/11: Gather the list of sources for all the images for all the figures so we properly cite/thank the people.

****** END OF MANUSCRIPT PROJECTS ******

FIGURE OUT WHY NUMBERS ARE WEIRD FOR PHOSPHO HISTONE 3 DATA IN DATABASE - e.g. why isn't pH3 staining within the nucleus???

Note: sample 48 = String, sample 340 = CyclinA

Anne 12/23: I noticed something peculiar in the movie I am analyzing - several texture measures came out equal to 1 for every image: Contrast, InformationMeasure1, and DifferenceVariance. Can you check whether this is true for other images, and if it's a bug? [Anne asked Ola 1/9/06]

Anne 12/23: Matlab license issues - think ahead whether we will need to license matlab on the whole cluster next year? did you hear from fran?  If it helps for us to cut back the needed licenses, you could put on your TODO long term to get the cluster compiled version figured out.

Anne 1/5: we might need to process Jason's human images to produce the last  figure of the paper. This is just a reminder that this might be a project down the road. It would give you the chance to process images on the cluster.

- (Anne 12/15) - Sometime in January, process BioImage and Vitra cytoplasm to nucleus translocation data sets and send results to Ilya for publication!

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - It'd be fun to see how long an image processing run takes on Matlab developer's version vs. the compiled version (which ought to be faster).  Eventually, we probably should do some real test runs (on the final version) so we can state in the paper the expected difference in speed between the two versions.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES
