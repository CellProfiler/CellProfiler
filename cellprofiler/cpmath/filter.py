    # The steps involved:
    #
    # * Smooth using the Gaussian with sigma above.
    #
    # * Apply the horizontal and vertical Sobel operators to get the gradients
    #   within the image. The edge strength is the sum of the magnitudes
    #   of the gradients in each direction.
    #
    # * Find the normal to the edge at each point using the arctangent of the
    #   ratio of the Y sobel over the X sobel - pragmatically, we can
    #   look at the signs of X and Y and the relative magnitude of X vs Y
    #   to sort the points into 4 categories: horizontal, vertical,
    #   diagonal and antidiagonal.
    #
    # * Look in the normal and reverse directions to see if the values
    #   in either of those directions are greater than the point in question.
    #   Use interpolation to get a mix of points instead of picking the one
    #   that's the closest to the normal.

class KalmanState(object):
    '''A data structure representing the state at a frame
    
    The original method uses "feature" to mean the same thing as
    CellProfiler's "object".
    
    The state vector is somewhat abstract: it's up to the caller to
    determine what each of the indices mean. For instance, in a model
    with a 2-d position and velocity component, the state might be
    i, j, di, dj
    
    .observation_matrix - matrix to transform the state vector into the
                          observation vector. The observation matrix gives
                          the dimensions of the observation vector from its
                          i-shape and the dimensions of the state vector
                          from its j-shape. For observations of position
                          and states with velocity, the observation matrix
                          might be:
                          
                          np.array([[1,0,0,0],
                                    [0,1,0,0]])
                          
    .translation_matrix - matrix to translate the state vector from t-1 to t
                          For instance, the translation matrix for position
                          and velocity might be:
                          
                          np.array([[1,0,1,0],
                                    [0,1,0,1],
                                    [0,0,1,0],
                                    [0,0,0,1]])
    
    .state_vec - an array of vectors per feature
    
    .state_cov - the covariance matrix yielding the prediction. Each feature
                has a 4x4 matrix that can be used to predict the new value
                
    .noise_var - the variance of the state noise for each feature for each
                vector element
                
    .state_noise - a N x 4 array: the state noise for the i, j, vi and vj
    
    .state_noise_idx - the feature indexes for each state noise vector
    
    .obs_vec   - the prediction for the observed variables

    '''The parity of a permutation
    
    The parity of a permutation is even if the permutation can be
    formed by an even number of transpositions and is odd otherwise.
    
    The parity of a permutation is even if there are an even number of
    compositions of even size and odd otherwise. A composition is a cycle:
    for instance in (1, 2, 0, 3), there is the cycle: (0->1, 1->2, 2->0)
    and the cycle, (3->3). Both cycles are odd, so the parity is even:
    you can exchange 0 and 1 giving (0, 2, 1, 3) and 2 and 1 to get
    (0, 1, 2, 3)

    '''Estimate the solution to the Poisson Equation
    
    The Poisson Equation is the solution to gradient(x) = h^2/4 and, in this
    context, we use a boundary condition where x is zero for background
    pixels. Also, we set h^2/4 = 1 to indicate that each pixel is a distance
    of 1 from its neighbors.
    
    The estimation exits after max_iter iterations or if the given percentile
    of foreground pixels differ by less than the convergence fraction
    from one pass to the next.
    
    Some ideas taken from Gorelick, "Shape representation and classification
    using the Poisson Equation", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and
    Machine Intelligence V28, # 12, 2006
    
    image - binary image with foreground as True
    gradient - the target gradient between 4-adjacent pixels
    max_iter - maximum # of iterations at a given level
    convergence - target fractional difference between values from previous 
                  and next pass
    percentile - measure convergence at this percentile
