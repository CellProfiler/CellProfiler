''' lapjv.py - Jonker-Volgenant algorithm for linear assignment problem.

This is an implementation of the Jonker-Volgenant algorithm for solving
the linear assignment problem. The code is derived from the paper,

and Sparse Linear Assignment Problems", Computing 38, p 325-340, 1987

    i,j - similarly-sized vectors that pair the object at index i[n] with
          the object at index j[j]
          
    costs - a vector of similar size to i and j that is the cost of pairing
            i[n] with j[n].
            
    wants_dual_variables - the dual problem reduces the costs using two
            vectors, u[i] and v[j] where the solution is the maximum value of
            np.sum(u) + np.sum(v) where cost[i,j] - u[i] - v[j] >=  0.
            Set wants_dual_variables to True to have u and v returned in
            addition to the assignments.
            
    augmenting_row_reductions - the authors suggest that augmenting row reduction
            be performed twice to optimize the u and v before the augmenting
            stage. The caller can choose a different number of reductions
            by supplying a different value here.

    All costs not appearing in i,j are taken as infinite. Each i in the range,
    0 to max(i) must appear at least once and similarly for j.
    
    returns (x, y), the pairs of assignments that represent the solution
    or (x, y, u, v) if the dual variables are requested.
