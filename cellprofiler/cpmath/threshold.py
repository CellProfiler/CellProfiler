                         each object
    image - a NxM numpy array of the image data

    Returns a tuple of local_threshold and global_threshold where:
    * global_threshold is the single number calculated using the threshold
    method over the whole image
    * local_threshold is the global_threshold for global methods. For adaptive
    and per-object thresholding, local_threshold is a matrix of threshold
    values representing the threshold to be applied at each pixel of the
    image.
    
    Different methods have optional and required parameters:
    Required:
    TM_PER_OBJECT:
    labels - a labels matrix that defines the extents of the individual objects
             to be thresholded separately.
    
    Optional:
    All:
    mask - a mask of the significant pixels in the image
    threshold_range_min, threshold_range_max - constrain the threshold
        values to be examined to values between these limits
    threshold_correction_factor - the calculated threshold is multiplied
        by this number to get the final threshold
    TM_MOG (mixture of Gaussians):
    object_fraction - fraction of image expected to be occupied by objects
        (pixels that are above the threshold)
    TM_OTSU - We have algorithms derived from Otsu. There is a three-class
              version of Otsu in addition to the two class. There is also
              an entropy measure in addition to the weighted variance.
              two_class_otsu - assume that the distribution represents
                               two intensity classes if true, three if false.
              use_weighted_variance - use Otsu's weighted variance if true,
                                      an entropy measure if false
              assign_middle_to_foreground - assign pixels in the middle class
                               in a three-class Otsu to the foreground if true
                               or the background if false.

    is an initial guess of the prior probability of an object pixel, or
