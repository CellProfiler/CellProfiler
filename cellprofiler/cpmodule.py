    """ Derive from the abstract module class to create your own module in Python
    
    You need to implement the following in the derived class:
    create_settings - create the settings that configure the module.
    settings - return the settings that will be loaded or saved from/to the
               pipeline.
    run - to run the module, producing measurements, etc.
    
    These methods are optional:
    prepare_settings - adjust the internal state of a module to accept a set of 
               stored settings, (e.g., to create the right number of image
               entries in the module's settings.)
    visible_settings - return the settings that will be displayed on the UI
               (default is to use the output of settings())
    upgrade_settings - rewrite a group of settings from a previous version to 
               be compatible with the latest version of a module.
    
    Implement these if you produce measurements:
    get_categories - The category of measurement produced, for instance AreaShape
    get_measurements - The measurements produced by a category
    get_measurement_images - The images measured for a particular measurement
    get_measurement_scales - the scale at which a measurement was taken
    get_measurement_columns - the measurements stored in the database
    
    The pipeline calls hooks in the module before and after runs and groups.
    The hooks are:
    prepare_run - before run: useful for setting up image sets
    prepare_group - before group: useful for initializing aggregation
    post_group - after group: useful for calculating final aggregation steps
               and for writing out results.
    post_run - use this to perform operations on the results of the experiment,
               for instance on all measurements
    post_pipeline_load - use this to update any settings that require the pipeline
                to be available before they can be adjusted.
                
    If your module requires state across image_sets, think of storing that 
    state in the image_set_list's legacy_fields dictionary instead
    of the module.
