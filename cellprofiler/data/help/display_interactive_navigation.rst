Using The Interactive Navigation Toolbar
========================================

All figure windows come with a navigation toolbar, which can be used to
navigate through the data set.

-  **Home, Forward, Back buttons:** *Home* |image0| always takes you to
   the initial, default view of your data. The *Forward* |image1|  and
   *Back* |image2| buttons are akin to the web browser forward and back
   buttons in that they are used to navigate back and forth between
   previously defined views, one step at a time. They will not be
   enabled unless you have already navigated within an image else using
   the **Pan** and **Zoom** buttons, which are used to define new views.
-  **Pan/Zoom button:** This button has two modes: pan and zoom. Click
   the toolbar button |image3| to activate panning and zooming, then put
   your mouse somewhere over an axes, where it will turn into a hand
   icon.

   -  *Pan:* Press the left mouse button and hold it to pan the figure,
      dragging it to a new position. Press Ctrl+Shift with the pan tool
      to move in one axis only, which one you have moved farther on.
      Keep in mind that that this button will allow you pan outside the
      bounds of the image; if you get lost, you can always use the
      **Home** to back you back to the initial view.
   -  *Zoom:* You can zoom in and out of a plot by pressing Ctrl (Mac)
      or holding down the right mouse button (Windows) while panning.
      Once you’re done, the right click menu will pop up when you’re
      done with the action; dismiss it by clicking off the plot. This is
      a known bug to be corrected in the next release.

-  **Zoom-to-rectangle button:** Click this toolbar button |image4|  to
   activate this mode. To zoom in, press the left mouse button and drag
   in the window to draw a box around the area you want to zoom in on.
   When you release the mouse button, the image is re-drawn to display
   the specified area. Remember that you can always use *Backward*
   button to go back to the previous zoom level, or use the *Home*
   button to reset the window to the initial view.
-  **Save:** Click this button |image5|  to launch a file save dialog.
   You can save the figure window to an image file. Note that this will
   save the entire contents of the window, not just the individual
   subplot(s) or images.
