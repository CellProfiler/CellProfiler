Using The Display Window Menu Bar
=================================

From the menu bar of each module display window, you have the following
options:

-  **File**

   -  *Save:* You can save the figure window to an image file. Note that
      this will save the entire contents of the window, not just the
      individual subplot(s) or images.
   -  *Save table:* This option is only enabled on windows which are
      displaying tabular output, such as that from a **Measure** module.
      This allows you to save the tabular data to a comma-delimited file
      (CSV).

-  **Tools**

   -  *Measure length:* Select this option to measure distances within
      an image window. If you click on an image and drag, a line will
      appear between the two endpoints, and the distance between them
      will be shown at the right-most portion of the bottom panel. This is
      useful for measuring distances in order to obtain estimates of
      typical object diameters for use in **IdentifyPrimaryObjects**.

-  **Subplots:** If the module display window has multiple subplots
   (such as **IdentifyPrimaryObjects**), the Image Tool options for the
   individual subplots are displayed here. See
   *Help > Using Module Display Windows > How To Use The Image Tools* for
   more details.
