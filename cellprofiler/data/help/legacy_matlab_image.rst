MATLAB Format Images
====================

Previous versions of CellProfiler supported reading and writing of MATLAB
format (.mat) images. MATLAB format images were useful for exporting
illumination correction functions generated by **CorrectIlluminationCalculate**.
These images could be loaded and applied to other pipelines using
**CorrectIlluminationApply**.

This version of CellProfiler no longer supports exporting MATLAB format
images. Instead, the recommended image format for illumination correction
functions is NumPy (.npy). Loading MATLAB format images is deprecated and
will be removed in a future version of CellProfiler. To ensure compatibility
with future versions of CellProfiler you can convert your .mat files to .npy
files via **SaveImages** using this version of CellProfiler.

See **SaveImages** for more details on saving NumPy format images.
