Using the Window Menu
=====================

The *Windows* menu provides options for showing and hiding the module
display windows.

-  **Close All Open Windows:** Closes all display windows that are
   currently open.
-  **Show All Windows On Run:** Select to show all display windows
   during the current test run or next analysis run. The display mode
   icons next to each module in the pipeline panel will switch to
   |image0|.
-  **Hide All Windows On Run:** Select to show no display windows during
   the current test run or next analysis run. The display mode icons
   next to each module in the pipeline panel will switch to |image1|.

If there are any open windows, the window titles are listed underneath
these options. Select any of these window titles to bring that window to
the front.
