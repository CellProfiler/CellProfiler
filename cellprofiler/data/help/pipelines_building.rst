How To Build A Pipeline
=======================

A *pipeline* is a sequential set of image analysis modules. The best way
to learn how to use CellProfiler is to load an example pipeline from the
CellProfiler website’s Examples page and try it with its included images,
then adapt it for
your own images. You can also build a pipeline from scratch. Click the
*Help* |HelpContent_BuildPipeline_image0|  button in the main window to get help for a specific
module.

Loading an existing pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Put the images and pipeline into a folder on your computer.
#. Set the Default Output Folder (press the “View output settings”) to
   the folder where you want to place your output (preferably a
   different location than in the input images).
#. Load the pipeline using *File > Import Pipeline > From File…* in the
   main menu of CellProfiler, or drag and drop it to the pipeline window.
#. Click the *Analyze Images* button to start processing.
#. Examine the measurements using *Data tools*. The *Data tools* options
   are accessible in the main menu of CellProfiler and allow you to
   plot, view, or export your measurements (e.g., to Excel).
#. Alternately, you can load data into CellProfiler Analyst for more
   complex analysis. Please refer to its help for instructions.
#. If you modify the modules or settings in the pipeline, you can save
   the pipeline using *File > Export > Pipeline…*. Alternately, you can
   save the project as a whole using *File > Save Project* or *Save
   Project As…* which also saves the file list, i.e., the list of images.
#. To learn how to use a cluster of computers to process large batches
   of images, see *Help > Batch Processing*.

Building a pipeline from scratch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Constructing a pipeline involves placing individual modules into a
pipeline. The list of modules in the pipeline is shown in the *pipeline
panel* (located on the left-hand side of the CellProfiler window).

#. *Place analysis modules in a new pipeline.*

   Choose image analysis modules to add to your pipeline by clicking the
   *Add* |HelpContent_BuildPipeline_image1| button (located underneath the pipeline panel) or
   right-clicking in the pipeline panel itself and selecting a module
   from the pop-up box that appears.

   You can learn more about each module by clicking *Module Help* in the
   “Add modules” window or the *?* button after the module has been
   placed and selected in the pipeline. Modules are added to the end of
   the pipeline or after the currently selected module, but you can
   adjust their order in the main window by dragging and dropping them,
   or by selecting a module (or modules, using the *Shift* key) and
   using the *Move Module Up* |HelpContent_BuildPipeline_image2| and *Move Module Down*
   |HelpContent_BuildPipeline_image3| buttons. The *Remove Module* |HelpContent_BuildPipeline_image4| button will delete the
   selected module(s) from the pipeline.

   Most pipelines depend on one major step: identifying the objects,
   (otherwise known as “segmentation”). In
   CellProfiler, the objects you identify are called *primary*,
   *secondary*, or *tertiary*:

   -  **IdentifyPrimary** modules identify objects without relying on
      any information other than a single grayscale input image (e.g.,
      nuclei are typically primary objects).
   -  **IdentifySecondaryObjects** modules require a grayscale image
      plus an image where primary objects have already been identified,
      because the secondary objects are determined based on the primary
      objects (e.g., cells can be secondary objects when their
      identification is based on the location of nuclei).
   -  **IdentifyTertiary** modules require images in which two sets of
      objects have already been identified (e.g., nuclei and cell
      regions are used to define cytoplasm objects, which are
      tertiary objects).

#. *Adjust the settings in each module.*

   In the CellProfiler main window, click a module in the pipeline to
   see its settings in the settings panel. To learn more about the
   settings for each module, select the module in the pipeline and
   click the *Help* button to the right of each setting, or at the
   bottom of the pipeline panel for the help for all the settings for
   that module.

   If there is an error with the settings (e.g., a setting refers to an
   image that doesn’t exist yet), a |HelpContent_BuildPipeline_image5| icon will appear next to the
   module name. If there is a warning (e.g., a special notification
   attached to a choice of setting), a |HelpContent_BuildPipeline_image6| icon will appear. Errors
   will cause the pipeline to fail upon running, whereas a warning will
   not. Once the errors/warnings have been resolved, a |HelpContent_BuildPipeline_image7|  icon will
   appear indicating that the module is ready to run.

#. *Set your Default Output Folder and, if necessary, your Default Input Folder*

   Both of these can be set via *File > Preferences…*.  Default Output Folder can
   be additionally changed by clicking the *View output settings* button directly
   below the list of modules in the pipeline; if any modules in your pipeline have
   referenced the Default Input Folder it will also appear in *View output settings*.

#. *Click *Analyze images* to start processing.*

   All of the images in your selected folder(s) will be analyzed using
   the modules and settings you have specified. The bottom of the
   CellProfiler window will show:

   -  A *pause button* |HelpContent_BuildPipeline_image8|  which pauses execution and allows you
      to subsequently resume the analysis.
   -  A *stop button* |HelpContent_BuildPipeline_image9|  which cancels execution after prompting
      you for a place to save the measurements collected to that point.
   -  A *progress bar* which gives the elapsed time and estimates the
      time remaining to process the full image set.

   At the end of each cycle:

   -  If you are creating a MATLAB or HDF5 output file, CellProfiler saves the measurements in the output file.
   -  If you are using the **ExportToDatabase** module, CellProfiler saves the measurements in the
      output database.
   -  If you are using the **ExportToSpreadsheet** module, CellProfiler saves the measurements *into a
      temporary file*; spreadsheets are not written until all modules have been processed.

#. *Click *Start Test Mode* to preview results.*

   You can optimize your pipeline by selecting the *Test* option from
   the main menu. Test mode allows you to run the pipeline on a
   selected image, preview the results, and adjust the module settings
   on the fly. See *Help > Testing Your Pipeline* for more details.

#. Save your project (which includes your pipeline) via *File > Save
   Project*.

*Saving images in your pipeline:* Due to the typically high number of
intermediate images produced during processing, images produced during
processing are not saved to the hard drive unless you specifically
request it, using a **SaveImages** module.

*Saving data in your pipeline:* You can include an **Export** module to
automatically export data in a format you prefer. See
*Help > Using Your Output* for more details.
