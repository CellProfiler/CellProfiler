LEGACY_LOAD_MODULES_HELP = """
<p>Historically, two modules served the same functionality as the current project structure:
<b>LoadImages</b> and <b>LoadData</b>.
While the approach described above supersedes these modules in part, old pipelines
loaded into CellProfiler that contain these modules will provide the option of preserving them;
these pipelines will operate exactly as before.</p>
<p>Alternately, the user can choose to convert these
modules into the project equivalent as closely as possible. Both modules remain accesible
via the "Add module" and <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;
button at the bottom of the pipeline panel. The section details
information relevant for users who would like to continue using these modules. Please note,
however, that these modules are deprecated and may be removed in the future.</p>

<h3>Associating metadata with images</h3>
<p>Metadata (i.e., additional data about image data) is sometimes available for input images.
This information can be:
<ol>
<li>Used by CellProfiler to group images with common metadata identifiers (or "tags")
together for particular steps in a pipeline;</li>
<li>Stored in the output file along with CellProfiler-measured features for
annotation or sample-tracking purposes;
<li>Used to name additional input/output files.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Two sources of metadata are:
<ul>
<li><i>Metadata provided in the image filename or location (pathname).</i> For example, images produced by an automated
microscope can be given names similar to "Experiment1_A01_w1_s1.tif" in which the metadata about the
plate ("Experiment1"), the well ("A01"), the wavelength number ("w1") and the imaging site ("s1") are encapsulated. The
name of the folder in which the images are saved may be meaningful and may also be considered metadata as well.
If this is the case for your data, use <b>LoadImages</b> to extract this information for
use in the pipeline and storage in the output file.</li>
<li><i>Metadata provided as a table of information</i>. Often, information associated with each image (such as
treatment, plate, well, etc) is available as a separate spreadsheet. If this is the case for your data, use
<b>LoadData</b> to load this information.</li>
</ul>
Details for the metadata-specific help is given next to the appropriate settings in
<b>LoadImages</b> and <b>LoadData</b>, as well the specific settings in other modules which
can make use of metadata. However, here is an overview of how metadata is obtained and used.</p>

<p>In <b>LoadImages</b>, metadata can be extracted from the filename and/or folder
location using regular expression, a specialized syntax used for text pattern-matching.
These regular expressions can be used to identify different parts of the filename / folder.
The syntax <i>(?P&lt;fieldname&gt;expr)</i> will extract whatever matches <i>expr</i> and
assign it to the image's <i>fieldname</i> measurement. A regular expression tool is available
which will allow you to check the accuracy of your regular expression.</p>

<p>For instance, say a researcher has folder names with the date and subfolders containing the
images with the run ID (e.g., <i>./2009_10_02/1234/</i>).
The following regular expression will capture the plate, well and site in the fields
<i>Date</i> and <i>Run</i>:<br>
<table border = "1">
<tr><td colspan = "2">.*[\\\/](?P&lt;Date&gt;.*)[\\\\/](?P&lt;Run&gt;.*)$ </td></tr>
<tr><td>.*[\\\\/]</td><td>Skip characters at the beginning of the pathname until either a slash (/) or
backslash (\\) is encountered (depending on the OS). The extra slash for the backslash is used as
an escape sequence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>(?P&lt;Date&gt;</td><td>Name the captured field <i>Date</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>.*</td><td>Capture as many characters that follow</td></tr>
<tr><td>[\\\\/]</td><td>Discard the slash/backslash character</td></tr>
<tr><td>(?P&lt;Run&gt;</td><td>Name the captured field <i>Run</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>.*</td><td>Capture as many characters as follow</td></tr>
<tr><td>$</td><td>The <i>Run</i> field must be at the end of the path string, i.e. the
last folder on the path. This also means that the <i>Date</i> field contains the parent
folder of the <i>Date</i> folder.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In <b>LoadData</b>, metadata is extracted from a CSV (comma-separated) file
(a spreadsheet). Columns whose name begins with "Metadata" can be used to group
files loaded by <b>LoadData</b> that are associated with a common metadata value.
The files thus grouped together are then processed as a distinct image set.</p>

<p>For instance, an experiment might require that images created on the same day
use an illumination correction function calculated from all images from that day,
and furthermore, that the date be captured in the file names for the individual image
sets and in a CSV file specifying the illumination correction functions. </p>

<p>In this case, if the illumination correction images are loaded with the
<b>LoadData</b> module, the file should have a "Metadata_Date"
column which contains the date metadata tags. Similarly, if the individual images
are loaded using the <b>LoadImages</b> module, <b>LoadImages</b> should be set to extract the
<Date> metadata tag from the file names. The pipeline will then match the individual
images with their corresponding illumination correction functions based on matching
"Metadata_Date" fields.</p>

<h3>Using image grouping</h3>
<p>To use grouping, you must define the relevant metadata for each image. This can be done using regular
expressions in <b>LoadImages</b> or having them pre-defined in a CSV file for use in <b>LoadData</b>.</p>

<p>To use image grouping in <b>LoadImages</b>, please note the following:
<ul>
<li><i>Metadata tags must be specified for all images listed.</i> You cannot use
grouping unless an appropriate regular expression is defined for all the images listed
in the module.</li>
<li><i>Shared metadata tags must be specified with the same name for each image listed.</i> For example, if you
are grouping on the basis of a metadata tag "Plate" in one image channel, you
must also specify the "Plate" metadata tag in the regular expression for the other channels that you
want grouped together.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>output file</i> is a file where all information about the analysis as well
as any measurements will be stored to the hard drive. <b>Important note:</b> This file
does <i>not</i> provide the same functionality as the Export modules. If you want to
produce a spreadsheet of measurements easily readable by Excel or a database viewer
(or similar programs), please refer to the <b>ExportToSpreadsheet</b> or
<b>ExportToDatabase</b> modules and the associated help.</p>

<p>The options associated with the output file are accessible by pressing the
"View output settings" button at the bottom of the pipeline panel. In the

use it instead. You can override this behavior by checking the <i>Allow
overwrite?</i> box to the right.</p>

<p>For analysis runs that generate a large number of measurements, you may notice
that even though the analysis completes, CellProfiler continues to use
an inordinate amount of your CPU and RAM. This is because the output file is written
after the analysis is completed and can take a very long time for a lot of measurements.

from the "Measurements file format" drop-down box.</p>""" % globals()

NEW_FEATURES_HELP = """
A number of new features have been incorporated into this re-engineered Python
version of CellProfiler:
<h3>Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>Resizable user interface: </i>The main CellProfiler interface can now be resized
by dragging the window corner.</li>
<li><i>Help for individual module settings:</i> Every setting in every module now has
a help button that you can click to display information and advice for that setting.</li>
<li><i>Settings verification:</i> CellProfiler constantly checks for setting values
that are not allowed, and immediately flags them for you.</li>
<li><i>Context-dependent module settings</i>: Prior versions of CellProfiler
displayed all settings for each module, whether or not the values were necessary,
given existing choices for other settings. Now, only those settings
you require are displayed, simplifying the interface.</li>
<li><i>Test mode for assay development:</i> This feature allows you to
preview the effect of a module setting on your data. You can step backward or forward
in the pipeline as you modify settings, optimizing your results prior to running an
actual analysis.</li>
<li><i>Unlimited number of images/objects as module input:</i> Some modules can accept an arbitrary number
of images or objects as input, and you can dynamically add or remove any of these inputs as needed.
For example, you can specify any number of single images in LoadSingleImage; previously,
the module could accept only three input images at a time. For example, in OverlayOutlines, you can specify that any number of outlines be
overlaid on an image; previously, you would have had to string multiple OverlayOutline modules
together.</li>
<li><i>Image grouping:</i> Images which share common metadata tags, whether
provided in the filename or in an accompanying text data file, can be processed together.
This is useful for any situation in which the images are organized
in groups  and each group needs to be analyzed as an individual set, such as
illumination correction for multiple plates.</li>
<li><i>Module drag and drop:</i> You can drag and drop selected modules
within a pipeline or into another instance of CellProfiler, keeping their associated
settings intact.</li>
<li><i>Listing of recent pipelines:</i> A selectable list of recently used pipelines
is available from the menu bar, for easy access.</li>
<li><i>Figure display choice:</i> Easier access to which module figure display windows are shown.
This functionality is now controlled within the pipeline, and is saved as part of the pipeline.
<li><i>Context menus:</i>  The pipeline panel responds to right-clicks, providing
easy access to module manipulation or help.</li>
<li><i>Error handling:</i> This feature sends bug reports (stack traces) to our developers.
<li><i>Better access for developers:</i> We are providing a developer's guide
as a practical introduction for programming in the CellProfiler environment, an
email list, and wiki, in addition to the available user <a href="http://cellprofiler.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=15">forum</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Module improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>Improved Otsu thresholding:</i> Choose two- or three-class thresholding to handle
images where there might be an intermediate intensity level between foreground and
background.</li>
<li>Secondary object identification now permits discarding of objects touching
the image border, along with the associated primary objects.</li>
<li>Filtering objects by measurements now permits a set of objects to be filtered
with any number of measurements. </li>
<li><i>Masking of images/objects:</i> You can create masks for use with both
images and objects such that image/object measurements will include only those
regions within the masked area.</li>
<li><i>Improved loading of text information:</i> Previously, you could load only a
limited amount of annotation relevant to your images, via a text file. Now you can use
comma-delimited files to load tables of metadata, in addition to lists of input
images for analysis.</li>
<li><i>Convex hull</i> has been included as an image morphological operation.</li>
<li>A new module, MeasureNeurons, has been added, which measures the number
of trunks and branches for each neuron in an image.</li>
<li><i>Detection of new features:</i> Neurites can be extracted from images of neurons.
Branching points of line segments can be found as an image morphological operation.
Also, "dark holes" (dark spots surrounded bright rings) can be detected. </li>
<li><i>Improvements to object tracking:</i> A new tracking algorithm has been added
to the TrackObjects module which is capable of bridging temporal gaps in trajectories
and accounting for splitting/merging events.</li>
<li><i>Per-object data exporting:<i> Object data can be exported to a database as a single table containing
all user-defined object measurements, or as separate tables, one for each object.
<li><i>SQLite support:</i> Data can be exported in SQLite, a
self-contained database format. Users can create their own local databases and
no longer need access to a separate database server. Because CellProfiler
Analyst also supports SQLite, any user can access CellProfiler Analyst's
suite of data exploration and machine-leaning tools without installing a complicated database server.</li>

"""

WHEN_CAN_I_USE_CELLPROFILER_HELP = """

<p>Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use
light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There
is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated
microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information
sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.</p>

<p>CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data
from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments. CellProfiler
is designed for modular, flexible, high-throughput analysis of images, measuring
size, shape, intensity, and texture of every cell (or other object) in every image.
Using the point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI), users construct an image
analysis "pipeline", a sequential series of modules that each perform
an image processing function such as illumination correction, object identification
(segmentation), and object measurement. Users mix and match modules and adjust
their settings to measure the phenotype of interest. While originally designed for
high-throughput images, it is equally appropriate for low-throughput assays as
well (i.e., assays of &lt; 100 images).</p>

<p>CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly
while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. It helps researchers
approach a variety of biological questions quantitatively, including standard
assays (e.g., cell count, size, per-cell protein levels) as well as complex
morphological assays (e.g., cell/organelle shape or subcellular patterns of DNA
or protein staining).</p>

<p>The wide variety of measurements produced by CellProfiler serves as useful "raw material"
for machine learning algorithms. CellProfiler's companion software, CellProfiler Analyst,
has an interactive machine learning tool called Classifier which can learn to recognize a
phenotype of interest based on your guidance. Once you complete the training phase,
CellProfiler Analyst will score every object in your images based on CellProfiler's
measurements.  CellProfiler Analyst also contains tools for the interactive visualization
of the data produced by CellProfiler.</p>

<p>In summary, CellProfiler contains:
<ul>
<li>Advanced algorithms for image analysis that are able to accurately identify
crowded cells and non-mammalian cell types.</li>
<li>A modular, flexible design allowing analysis of new assays and phenotypes.</li>
<li>Open-source code so the underlying methodology is known and can be modified
or improved by others.</li>
<li>A user-friendly interface.</li>
<li>The capability to make use of clusters of computers when available.</li>
<li>A design that eliminates the tedium of the many steps typically involved in
image analysis, many of which are not easily transferable from one project to
another (for example, image formatting, combining several image analysis steps,
or repeating the analysis with slightly different parameters).</li>

<h3>Building a pipeline from scratch</h3>
<p>Constructing a pipeline involves placing individual modules into a pipeline. The list
of modules in the pipeline is shown in the <i>pipeline panel</i> (located on the
left-hand side of the CellProfiler window).</p>
<ol>
<li><p><i>Place analysis modules in a new pipeline.</i><br>
<p>Choose image analysis modules to add to your pipeline by clicking the <i>Add</i>
<img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button
(located underneath the pipeline panel) or right-clicking in the pipeline panel
itself and selecting a module from the
pop-up box that appears.</p>
<p>You can learn more about each module by clicking
<i>Module Help</i> in the "Add modules" window or the <i>?</i> button after the module
has been placed and selected in the pipeline. Modules are added to the end of the
pipeline or after the currently selected module, but you can
adjust their order in the main window by dragging and dropping them, or by selecting a module (or
modules, using the <i>Shift</i> key) and using the <i>Move Module Up</i>
<img src="memory:%(MODULE_MOVEUP_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;and <i>Move Module Down</i>
<img src="memory:%(MODULE_MOVEDOWN_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;buttons.
The <i>Remove Module</i> <img src="memory:%(MODULE_REMOVE_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button will
delete the selected module(s) from the pipeline.</p>
<p>Most pipelines depend on one major step: identifying the objects. In
CellProfiler, the objects you identify are called <i>primary</i>,
<i>secondary</i>, or <i>tertiary</i>:
<ul>
<li><b>IdentifyPrimary</b> modules identify objects without relying on any
information other than a single grayscale input image (e.g., nuclei are
typically primary objects).</li>
<li><b>IdentifySecondary</b> modules require a grayscale image plus an image
where primary objects have already been identified, because the secondary
objects are determined based on the primary objects (e.g., cells can be
secondary objects when their identification is based on the location of nuclei). </li>
<li><b>IdentifyTertiary</b> modules require images in which two sets of objects have
already been identified (e.g., nuclei and cell regions are used to define the
cytoplasm objects, which are tertiary objects).</li>
</ul></p>
</li>

<li><p><i>Adjust the settings in each module.</i><br>
In the CellProfiler main window, click a module in the pipeline to see its
settings in the settings panel. To learn more about the settings for each
module, select the module in the pipeline and click the <i>Help</i> button to the
right of each setting, or at the bottom of the pipeline panel
for the help for all the settings for that module.</p>
<p>If there is an error with the settings (e.g., a setting refers to an image
that doesn't exist yet),
a <img src="memory:%(SETTINGS_ERROR_ICON)s">&nbsp;icon will appear next to the
module name. If there is a warning (e.g., a special notification attached to a choice of setting),
a <img src="memory:%(SETTINGS_WARNING_ICON)s">&nbsp;icon will appear. Errors
will cause the pipeline to fail upon running, whereas a warning will not. Once
the errors/warnings have been resolved, a <img src="memory:%(SETTINGS_OK_ICON)s">
&nbsp;icon will appear indicating that the module is ready to run.</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>Set your Default Input Folder, Default Output Folder and output filename.</i><br>
For more help, click their nearby <i>Help</i> buttons in the main window. </p></li>

<li><p><i>Click <i>Analyze images</i> to start processing.</i><br>
All of the images in your selected folder(s) will be analyzed using the modules
and settings you have specified. A status window will appear which has the following:
<ul>
<li>A <i>progress bar</i> which gives the elapsed time and estimates the time remaining to
process the full image set.</li>
<li>A <i>pause button</i> <img src="memory:%(RUNSTATUS_PAUSE_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;
which pauses execution and allows you to subsequently
resume the analysis.
<li>A <i>stop button</i> <img src="memory:%(RUNSTATUS_STOP_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;
which cancels execution after prompting you for a place to
save the measurements collected to that point.</li>
<li>A <i>save measurements</i> button <img src="memory:%(RUNSTATUS_SAVE_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;
which will prompt you for a place to
save the measurements collected to that point while continuing the analysis run.</li>
</ul>
At the end of each cycle, CellProfiler saves the measurements in the output file.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Click <i>Start Test Mode</i> to preview results.</i><br>
You can optimize your pipeline by selecting the <i>Test</i> option from
the main menu. Test mode allows you to run the pipeline on a selected
image, preview the results, and adjust the module settings on the fly. See
<i>%(TEST_MODE_HELP_REF)s</i> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Save your project (which includes your pipeline) via <i>File > Save Project</i>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Saving images in your pipeline:</i> Due to the typically high number
of intermediate images produced during processing, images produced during
processing are not saved to the hard drive unless you specifically request it,
using a <b>SaveImages</b> module.</p>
<p><i>Saving data in your pipeline:</i> You can include an <b>Export</b> module to automatically export
data in a format you prefer. See <i>%(USING_YOUR_OUTPUT_REF)s</i> for more details.</p>

SPREADSHEETS_DATABASE_HELP = """
<p>The most common form of output for cellular analysis is a <i>spreadsheet<i>, which is an application which
tabulates data values.
CellProfiler can also output data into a <i>database</i>, which is a collection of
data that is stored for retrieval by users. Which format you use will depend on
some of the considerations below:
<ul>
<li><i>Assessibility:</i> Spreadsheet applications are typically designed to allow easy
user interaction with the data, to edit values, make graphs and the like. In contrast, the values in databases are
typically not modified after the fact. Instead, database applications typically allow for viewing a specific data range.</li>
<li><i>Capacity and speed:</i> Databases are designed to hold larger amounts of data than spreadsheets. Spreadsheets may contain
hundreds to a few thousand rows of data, whereas databases can hold mnay millions of rows of data. Due to the high
capacity, accessing a particular portion of data in a database is optimized for speed.</li>
<li><i>Learning curve:</i> The applications that access spreadsheets are usually made for ease-of-use to allow for user edits.
Databases are more sophisticated and are not typically edited or modified; to do so
require knowledge of specialized languages made for this purpose (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, etc).</li>

of interest, and move the slider to modules already executed.
<li><i>Pause:</i> Clicking the pause icon will cause the pipeline test run to halt
execution when that module is reached (the paused module itself is not executed). The icon
changes from <img src="memory:%(TESTMODE_GO_ICON)s">&nbsp;to
<img src="memory:%(TESTMODE_PAUSE_ICON)s">&nbsp;to indicate that a pause has

<p>CellProfiler is designed to analyze images in a high-throughput manner.
Once a pipeline has been established for a set of images, CellProfiler
can export batches of images to be analyzed on a computing cluster with the
pipeline. </p>

<p>It is possible to process tens or even hundreds of thousands of
images for one analysis in this manner. We do this by breaking the entire
set of images into separate batches, then submitting each of these batches
as individual jobs to a cluster. Each individual batch can be separately
analyzed from the rest.</p>

<h3>Submitting files for batch processing</h3>

Below is a basic workflow for submitting your image batches to the cluster.
<ol>
<li><i>Create a folder for your project on your cluster.</i> For high-throughput
analysis, it is recommended to create a separate project folder for each run. </li>
<li>Within this project folder, create the following folders (both of which must
be connected to the cluster computing network):
<ul>
<li>Create an input folder, then transfer all of your images to this folder
as the input folder. The input folder must be readable by everyone (or at least your
cluster) because each of the separate cluster computers will read input files from
this folder.
<li>Create an output folder where all your output data will be stored. The
output folder must be writeable by everyone (or at least your cluster) because
each of the separate cluster computers will write output files to this folder.
</ul>
If you cannot create folders and set read/write permissions to these folders (or don't know
how), ask your Information Technology (IT) department for help. </li>

<li>Press the "%(VIEW_OUTPUT_SETTINGS_BUTTON_NAME)s" button. In the panel that appears,
set the Default Input and Default Output Folders
to the <i>images</i> and <i>output</i> folders created above, respectively. The Default Input
Folder setting will only appear if a legacy pipeline is being run.</li>

<li><i>Create a pipeline for your image set.</i> You should test it on a few example
images from your image set (if you are unfamilar with the concept of an image set, please
see the help for the <b>Input</b> modules). The module settings selected for your pipeline will be
applied to <i>all</i> your images, but the results may vary
depending on the image quality, so it is critical to insure that your settings be
robust against your "worst-case" images.<br>
For instance, some images may contain no cells. If this happens, the automatic thresholding
algorithms will incorrectly choose a very low threshold, and therefore "find"
spurious objects. This can be overcome by setting a lower limit on the threshold in
the <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> module.<br>
The Test mode in CellProfiler may be used for previewing the results of your settings
on images of your choice. Please refer to <i>%(TEST_MODE_HELP_REF)s</i>

                       of images, you may also consider adding <b>ExportToDatabase</b> to your pipeline,

                       on your settings in the <b>Input</b> modules (this process can be sped
                       up by creating your list of images as a CSV and using the <b>LoadData</b> module to load it).

                       <i>Batch_data.h5</i>) and save it in the Default Output Folder (Step 1). The advantage of
                       using <b>CreateBatchFiles</b> from the researcher's perspective is that the Batch_data.h5
                       file generated by the module captures all of the data needed to run the analysis. You

                       </code>
                       This command submits the batch file to CellProfiler and specifies that CellProfiler run in a
                       batch mode without its user interface to process the pipeline.
                       This run can be modified by using additional options to CellProfiler that
                       specify the following:

                       Batch_data.h5 file output by the CreateBatchFiles module. When specified, CellProfiler
                       will output one line to the terminal per job to be run. This output should be further
                       processed to generate a script that can invoke the jobs in a cluster-computing context.<br>
                       The above notes assume that you are running CellProfiler using our source code (see
                       "Developer's Guide" under Help for more details). If you are using the compiled version,
                       you would replace <code>./python CellProfiler.py</code> with the CellProfiler

RUN_MULTIPLE_PIPELINES_HELP = """
<br>The <b>Run multiple pipelines</b> dialog lets you select several pipelines
which will be run consecutively. Please note the following:
<ul>
<li>CellProfiler 2.1 project files are not currently supported.</li>
<li>Pipelines from CellProfiler 2.0 and lower are supported.</li>
<li>If you want to use a pipeline made using CellProfiler 2.1, then you
need to include the project file list with the pipeline, by selecting <i>Export &gt;
Pipeline...</i>, and under the "Save as type" dropdown, select "CellProfiler
pipeline and file list".</li>
</ul>

<p>You can invoke <b>Run multiple pipelines</b> by selecting it from the file menu.
The dialog has three parts to it:
<br><ul><li><i>File chooser</i>: The file chooser lets you select the pipeline
files to be run. The <i>Select all</i> and <i>Deselect all</i> buttons to
the right will select or deselect all pipeline files in the list. The
<i>Add</i> button will add the pipelines to the pipeline list. You can add
a pipeline file multiple times, for instance if you want to run that pipeline
on more than one input folder.</li>
<li><i>Directory chooser</i>: The directory chooser lets you navigate to
different directories. The file chooser displays all pipeline files in the
directory chooser's current directory.</li>
<li><i>Pipeline list</i>: The pipeline list has the pipelines to be run in
the order that they will be run. Each pipeline has a default input and
output folder and a measurements file. You can change any of these by clicking
on the file name - an appropriate dialog will then be displayed. You can
click the remove button to remove a pipeline from the list</li></ul>
<br>
CellProfiler will run all of the pipelines on the list when you hit the
"OK" button."""

CONFIGURING_LOGGING_HELP = """
<br>CellProfiler prints diagnostic messages to the console by default. You
can change this behavior for most messages by configuring logging. The simplest
way to do this is to use the command-line switch, "-L", to set the log level.
For instance, to show error messages or more critical events, start CellProfiler
like this:
<br>
<code>CellProfiler -L ERROR</code>
<br>
The following is a list of log levels that can be used:
<ul>
<li><b>DEBUG:</b> Detailed diagnostic information</li>
<li><b>INFO:</b> Informational messages that confirm normal progress</li>
<li><b>WARNING:</b> Messages that report problems that might need attention</li>
<li><b>ERROR:</b> Messages that report unrecoverable errors that result in data loss or termination of the current operation.</li>
<li><b>CRITICAL:</b> Messages indicating that CellProfiler should be restarted or is incapable of running.</li></ul>
<br>
You can tailor CellProfiler's logging with much more control using a logging
configuration file. You specify the file name in place of the log level on
the command line, like this:
<br>
<code>CellProfiler -L ~/CellProfiler/my_log_config.cfg</code>
</br>
Files are in the Microsoft .ini format which is grouped into categories enclosed
in square brackets and the key/value pairs for each category.
Here is an example file:
<div><pre>
[loggers]
keys=root,pipelinestatistics

[handlers]
keys=console,logfile

[formatters]
keys=detailed

[logger_root]
level=WARNING
handlers=console

[logger_pipelinestatistics]
level=INFO
handlers=logfile
qualname=pipelineStatistics
propagate=0

[handler_console]
class=StreamHandler
formatter=detailed
level=WARNING

level=INFO
args=('~/CellProfiler/logfile.log','w')

[formatter_detailed]
format=[%(asctime)s] %(name)s %(levelname)s %(message)s
datefmt=
</pre></div>
The above file would print warnings and errors to the console for all messages
but "pipeline statistics" which are configured using the <i>pipelineStatistics</i>
logger are written to a file instead.. The pipelineStatistics logger is the
logger that is used to print progress messages when the pipeline is run. You
can find out which loggers are being used to write particular messages by
printing all messages with a formatter that prints the logger name ("%(name)s").

"""

ACCESSING_OMERO_IMAGES = """
CellProfiler has first-class support for loading images from
<a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero">OMERO</a>. The input modules
and the LoadData module can refer to images by URL, for instance, the example pipeline
on the welcome page loads its images from <code>http://cellprofiler.org/ExampleFlyImages</code>.
The first part of a URL (the part before the colon) is the schema. CellProfiler decides
which communication protocol to use, depending on the schema; in the case of the
example on the welcome page, the schema is HTTP and CellProfiler uses the HTTP
protocol to get the image data. For OMERO, the schema that should be used is "omero"
and we use the OMERO client library to fetch and load the data.

<p>OMERO URLs have the form, "omero:iid=". You can find the image IDs using either the
OMERO web client or the
<a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/downloads">Insight software</a>.
As an example, the screen capture below
indicates that the image, "Channel1-01-A-01.tif", has an IID of 58038:<br>
<img src="memory:%(OMERO_IMAGEID_PIC)s"></p>
<p>At present, manually curating the URL list can be somewhat time-consuming, but we
are planning to develop plug-ins for Insight that will automatically generate these
lists for CellProfiler from within the Insight user interface. The plugin will allow
you to select a screen or plate and export an image set list that can be used with
CellProfiler's LoadData module.</p>

<h3>OMERO login credentials</h3>

CellProfiler will ask you for your OMERO login credentials when you first access an
OMERO URL, either by viewing it from the file list or by loading it in a pipeline.
CellProfiler will create and maintain a session for you based on these credentials
until you close the application. You should only need to enter your credentials once.
To use the "Log into Omero" dialog, enter your server's name or IP address, the port
(usually 4064), your user name and password and press the "Connect" button. The
"Connect" button should turn green and the OK button of the dialog should become
enabled (see below). Press OK to complete the login.<br>
<img src="memory:%(OMERO_LOGIN_PIC)s">
<p>Currently, CellProfiler cannot establish a connection to OMERO when running
headless - to do that, we would need to store the user password where it might be
otherwise visible. We would like to provide a secure mechanism for establishing a
session when headless and would like to work with you to make this work in your
environment; please contact us for further information on how to modify CellProfiler
yourself to do this or with suggestions for us to implement.</p>

<h3>Using OMERO URLs with the Input modules</h3>

The <b>Images</b> module has a file list panel of all of the image files in a project.
This file list supports URLs including OMERO URLs. You can drag URLs from a text document
and drop them into the file list. The URLs do not end with image file extensions (like .TIF),
so you need to change the "Filter images?" setting to "No filtering" to allow the OMERO URLs
to be processed further. You should be able to view the image by double-clicking on it and
you should be able to extract plate, well, site and channel name metadata from each image
using the "Extract from image file headers" method in the <b>Metadata</b> module (press the
"Update Metadata" button after selecting the "Extract from image file headers" method).

If your experiment has more than one image channel, you can use the "ChannelName" metadata
extracted from the OMERO image to create image sets containing all of your image channels.
In the <b>NamesAndTypes</b> module, change the "Assign a name to" setting to "Images
matching rules". For the rule criteria, select "Metadata does have ChannelName matching"
and enter the name that appears under "Channels" in the OMERO Insight browser. Add additional
channels to <b>NamesAndTypes</b> using the "Add another image" button.

<h3>OMERO URLs and LoadData</h3>

The LoadData module reads image sets from a .CSV file. The CSV file has a one-line header
that tells LoadData how to use each of the columns of the file. You can load channels from
a URL by adding a "URL" tag to this header. The OMERO URLs themselves appear in rows below.
For instance, here is a .CSV that loads a DNA and GFP channel:
<pre>
URL_DNA,URL_GFP
omero:iid=58134,omero:iid=58038
omero:iid=58135,omero:iid=58039
omero:iid=58136,omero:iid=58040
</pre>

MEASUREMENT_NOMENCLATURE_HELP = """
In CellProfiler, measurements are exported as well as stored internally using the
following general nomenclature:
<code><i>MeasurementType_Category_SpecificFeatureName_Parameters</i></code>

<p>Below is the description for each of the terms:
<ul>
<li><code>MeasurementType</code>: The type of data contained in the measurement, which can be
one of three forms:
<ul>
<li><i>Per-image:</i> These measurements are image-based (e.g., thresholds, counts) and
are specified with the name "Image" or with the measurement (e.g.,
"Mean") for per-object measurements aggregated over an image.</li>
<li><i>Per-object:</i> These measurements are per-object and are specified as the name given
by the user to the identified objects (e.g., "Nuclei" or "Cells")</li>
<li><i>Experiment:</i> These measurements are produced for a particular measurement
across the entire analysis run (e.g., Z'-factors), and are specified with the
name "Experiment". See <b>CalculateStatistics</b> for an example.
</ul></li>

<li><code>Category:</code> Typically, this information is specified in one of two ways
<ul>
<li>A descriptive name indicative of the type of measurement taken (e.g., "Intensity")</li>
<li>No name if there is no appropriate <code>Category</code> (e.g., if the <i>SpecificFeatureName</i> is
"Count", no <code>Category</code> is specfied).</li>
</ul></li>

<li><code>SpecificFeatureName:</code> The specific feature recorded by a module (e.g.,
"Perimeter"). Usually the module recording the measurement assigns this name, but
a few modules allow the user to type in the name of the feature (e.g., the
<b>CalculateMath</b> module allows the user to name the arithmetic measurement).</li>

<li><code>Parameters:</code> This specifier is to distinguish measurements
obtained from the same objects but in different ways. For example,
<b>MeasureObjectIntensity</b> can measure intensities for "Nuclei" in two different
images. This specifier is used primarily for data obtained from an individual image
channel specified by the <b>Images</b> module or a legacy <b>Load</b> module
(e.g.,  "OrigBlue" and "OrigGreen") or a
particular spatial scale (e.g., under the category "Texture" or "Neighbors"). Multiple
parameters are separated by underscores.

<p>Below are additional details specific to various modules:
<ul>
<li>Measurements from the <i>AreaShape</i> and <i>Math</i> categories do not have a
<code>Parameter</code> specifier.</li>
<li>Measurements from <i>Intensity</i>, <i>Granularity</i>, <i>Children</i>,
<i>RadialDistribution</i>, <i>Parent</i> and
<i>AreaOccupied</i> categories will have an associated image as the Parameter.</li>
<li><i>Measurements from the <i>Neighbors</i> and <i>Texture</i> category will have a
spatial scale <code>Parameter</code>.</li>
<li>Measurements from the <i>Texture</i> and <i>RadialDistribution</i> categories will
have both a spatial scale and an image <code>Parameter</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example, consider a measurement specified as <code>Nuclei_Texture_DifferenceVariance_ER_3</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>MeasurementType</code> is "Nuclei," the name given to the detected objects by the user.</li>
<li><code>Category</code> is "Texture," indicating that the module <b>MeasureTexture</b>
produced the measurements.</li>
<li><code>SpecificFeatureName</code> is "DifferenceVariance," which is one of the many
texture measurements made by the <b>MeasureTexture</b> module.
<li>There are two <code>Parameters</code>, the first of which is "ER". "ER" is the user-provided
name of the image in which this texture measurement was made.</li>
<li>The second <code>Parameter</code> is "3", which is the spatial scale at which this texture
measurement was made.</li>
</ul>

of the modules, as well as <b>ExportToSpreadsheet</b> and <b>ExportToDatabase</b> modules.

The workspace viewer is a flexible tool that you can use to explore your
images, objects and measurements in test mode. To use the viewer, select
<i>View Workspace</i> from the <i>Test</i> menu after starting test mode. This
will display the CellProfiler Workspace, a window with an image pane to the
left and a panel of controls to the right.

<h3>Key concepts</h3>
<p>
The workspace viewer lets you examine the CellProfiler workspace as you
progress through your pipeline's execution. A pipeline's <i>workspace</i>
is the collection of images, objects and measurements that are produced
by the modules. At the start of the pipeline,
the only things that are available are the images and objects loaded by the
input modules. New images, objects and measurements are added to the workspace
as you step through modules. If you modify a module's setting and re-execute
the module, the images, objects and measurements produced by that module
will be overwritten.</p>

<p>The selected views are persistent across image cycles. That is, you can set up the viewer to view
the workspace at the end of a pipeline cycle, then start a new cycle and
CellProfiler will fill in the images, objects and measurements that you have chosen to
display as they become available. You can also zoom in on a particular region
and change settings and the viewer will remain focused on that region with
the same settings across modules or image cycles.</p>

<p>All elements of the display are configurable, either through the Subplots menu
on the viewer, or through the context menu available by right-clicking on the figure
window.</p>

<h3>Available displays</h3>

<p>A number of displays are available on the right-side of the workspace viewer. You
can add, remove and modify displays of <i>images</i>, <i>objects</i>, <i>masks</i> and
<i>measurements</i>,

<h4>Images</h4>

<p>The workspace viewer can display any image that is available from the input
modules or from modules previously executed. To display a single image, select
it from the <i>Images</i> drop down and check the <i>Show</i> checkbox. Initially,
the image will be displayed in color, using the color shown in the "Color" box.
This color can be changed by clicking on the color box.
<br>
You can add images to the display by clicking the <i>Add Image</i> button. You
can remove images other than the first by hitting the button in the
<i>Remove</i> column. You can toggle the image display using the checkbox in the
<i>Show</i> column. You can also set the interpolation mode by selecting
<i>Interpolation</i> from the <i>Subplots</i> menu. </p>

<h4>Objects</h4>

<p>You can display the objects that have been created or loaded by all modules
that have been executed. To display a set of objects, select them from the
<i>Objects</i> drop-down and check the <i>Show</i> checkbox. You can add
additional objects by pressing the <i>Add Objects</i> button.</p>

<h4>Masks</h4>

<p>You can display the mask for any image produced by any of the modules that
have been executed. Most images are not masked. In these cases, you can
display the mask, but the display will show that the whole image is unmasked.
You can mask an image with the <b>MaskImage</b> or <b>Crop</b> modules.</p>

<p>To display the mask of an image, select it from the <i>Masks</i> dropdown and
check the <i>Show</i> checkbox. You can add additional masks by pressing the
<i>Add Mask</i> button. The options for masks are the same as that for
objects with the addition that you can invert and overlay the mask by choosing
<i>Inverted</i> from the mask's menu; the masked portion will be displayed
in color.</p>

<h4>Measurements</h4>

<p>You can display any measurement produced by any of the modules that have
been executed. Image measurements will be displayed in the title bar above
the image. Object measurements will be displayed centered over the measurement's
object. To display a measurement, select it from the <i>Measurements</i>
drop-down and check the <i>Show</i> checkbox next to the measurement. You can
add a measurement by pressing the <i>Add Measurement</i> button or remove it
by checking the button in the <i>Remove</i> column.</p>

<p>You can configure the font used to display an object measurement, the color
of the text, and the color, transparency and shape of the background behind
the text. To configure the measurement's appearance, press the <i>Font</i>
button to the right of the measurement. Press the <i>Font</i> button in the
<i>Measurement appearance</i> dialog to choose the font and its size, press
the <i>Text color</i> and <i>Background color</i> to change the color used
to display the text and background. Use the <i>Alpha</i> slider to control the
transparency of the background behind the measurement text. The <i>Box shape</i>
drop-down controls the shape of the background box. The <i>Precision</i>
control determines the number of digits displayed to the right of the
decimal point.</p>

<h3>Using the Subplot menu to configure the display</h3>

<p>The following items modify how the display is rendered. You can configure
them through the Subplots menu on the viewer, or through the context menu
available by right-clicking on the figure window.</p>

<h4>Interpolation</h4>

The interpolation mode used to render images, objects and masks is a
configuration option that applies to the entire workspace. Interpolation
controls how the intensities of pixels are blended together. You can set
the interpolation mode by selecting <i>Interpolation</i> from the
<i>Subplots</i> menu. The available modes are:
%(INTERPOLATION_MODE_HELP_LIST)s

<h4>Images</h4>

<p>You can change the way an image is scaled, you can change its display mode
and you can change its color and transparency from the menus. To do this,
select the image from the <i>Subplots</i> menu. The images that are shown
will appear in the menu under the <i>--- Images ---</i> heading. Select the
image you want to configure from the menu to display the options that are
available for that image. There are three categories in the menu, one for
intensity normalization, one for the display mode and one to adjust color
and transparency.</p>

<p>The intensity normalization mode controls how the pixel's intensity value is
translated into the brightness of a pixel on the screen. The modes that are
available are:
%(INTENSITY_MODE_HELP_LIST)s</p>

<p>The <i>Mode</i> controls how pixel intensities are mapped to colors in the
image. You can display each image using the following modes:
<ul>
<li><i>Color:</i> Pixels will have a uniform color which can be selected
by either clicking on the <i>Color</i> button next to the image name or
by choosing the image's <i>Color</i> menu entry.</li>
<li><i>Grayscale:</i> The image will be rendered in shades of gray. The
color choice will have no effect and the image's <i>Color</i> menu entry will
be unavailable.</li>
<li><i>Color map:</i> The image will be rendered using a palette. Your default
color map will be used initially. To change the color map, select
the image's <i>Color</i> menu entry from its menu and choose one of the
color maps from the drop-down. The display will change interactively as you
change the selection, allowing you to see the image as rendered by your choice.
Hit <i>OK</i> to accept the new color map or hit <i>Cancel</i> to use the
color map that was originally selected.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The image's <i>Alpha</i> menu entry lets you control the image's transparency.
This will let you blend colors when the palettes overlap and choose which
image's intensity has the highest priority. To change the transparency, select
<i>Alpha</i> from the image's menu. Adjust the transparency interactively
using the slider bar and hit <i>OK</i> to accept the new value or <i>Cancel</i>
to restore the value that was originally selected.</p>

<h4>Objects</h4>

<p>You can configure the appearance of objects using the context or <i>Subplots</i>
menu. Choose the objects you wish to configure from the <i>--- Objects ---</i>
list in the menu. You will see configuration menu items for the objects'
display mode, color and alpha value. You can display objects using one of the
following modes:
<ul>
<li><i>Lines:</i> This mode draws a line through the center of each pixel
that borders the background of the object or another object. It does not
display holes in the object. The line is drawn using the color shown in
the <i>Color</i> button next to the objects' name. This option does not
obscure the border pixels, but can take longer to render, especially if there
are a large number of objects.</li>
<li><i>Outlines:</i> This mode displays each pixel in the object's border using
the color shown in the <i>Color</i> button next to the objects' name. This
option will display holes in unfilled objects, but the display obscures the
image underneath the border pixels.</li>
<li><i>Overlay:</i> This mode displays a different color overlay over each
object's pixels. Each object is assigned a color using the default color map
initially. You can choose the color map by
selecting <i>Color</i> from the objects' menu and choosing one of the available
color maps. You can change the transparency of the overlay by choosing
<i>Alpha</i> from the objects' menu.</li>
</ul></p>

INTRODUCTION_TO_PROJECTS_HELP = """
<h3>What is a project?</h3>
<p>In CellProfiler, a <i>project</i> is comprised of two elements:
<ul>
<li>An <i>image file list</i> which is the list of files and their locations that are selected by the user as
candidates for analysis.</li>
<li>The <i>pipeline</i>, which is a series of modules put together used to analyze a set of images.</li>
<li>Optionally, the associated information about the images (<i>metadata</i>). This
information may be part of the images themselves, or imported externally by the user.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The project is the container for image information associated with a CellProfiler analysis. It stores
such details as:
<ul>
<li>What type of image(s) are the input files?</li>
<li>Where are the input images located?</li>
<li>What distinguishes multiple image channels from each other? How are these relationships
represented?</li>
<li>What information about the images and/or experiment is linked to the images, and how?</li>
<li>Are certain groups of images to be processed differently from other groups?</li>
</ul>
By using projects, the above information is stored along with the analysis pipeline and is
available on demand. </p>

<h3>Working with projects</h3>
<h4>Creating a project</h4>
<p>Upon starting CellProfiler, you will be presented with a new, blank project.
At this point, you may start building your project by using the modules located in the "Input
modules" panel on the upper-left. The modules are:
<ul>
<li><b>Images</b>: Assemble the relevant images for analysis (required).</li>
<li><b>Metadata</b>: Associate metadata with the images (optional).</li>
<li><b>NamesAndTypes</b>: Assign names to channels and define their relationship (required).</li>
<li><b>Groups</b>: Define sub-divisions between groups of images for processing (optional).</li>
</ul>
Detailed help for each module is provided by selecting the module and clicking the "?" button on
the bottom of CellProfiler.</p>

<h4>Saving a project</h4>
<p>As you work in CellProfiler, the project is updated automatically, so there is no need to
save it unless you are saving the project to a new name or location. You can always save your
current work to a new project file by selecting <i>File > Save Project As...</i>, which will
save your project, complete with the current image file list and pipeline, to a file with
with the extension <i>.cpproj</i>.</p>

<p>You also have the option of automatically saving the associated pipeline file and the file list
in addition to the project file. See <i>File &gt; Preferences...</i> for more details.</p>

<p>For those interested, some technical details:
<ul>
<li>The <i>.cpproj</i> file stores collected information using the HDF5 format. Documentation on
how measurements are stored and handled in CellProfiler using this format can be found
<a href="https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler/wiki/Module-Structure-and-Data-Storage-Retrieval#hdf5-measurement-and-workspace-format">here</a>.</li>
<li>All information is cached in the project file after it is computed. It is either
re-computed or retrieved from the cache when an analysis run is started, when
entering Test mode, or when the user requests a refreshed view of the information
(e.g., when a setting has been changed).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Legacy modules: LoadImages and LoadData</h4>
<p>Historically, two modules were used for project creation: <b>LoadImages</b> and <b>LoadData</b>.
While the approach described above partly supersedes these modules, you have the option
of preserving these modules if you load old pipelines into CellProfiler that contain them;
these pipelines will operate exactly as before.</p>
<p>Alternately, the user can choose to convert these
modules into the project equivalent as closely as possible. Both <b>LoadImages</b> and <b>LoadData</b>
remain accessible via the "Add module" and <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;
buttons at the bottom of the pipeline panel.</p>
""" % globals()

SELECTING_IMAGES_HELP = """
<p>Any image analysis project using CellProfiler begins with providing the program with a set of image files
to be analyzed. You can do this by clicking on
the <b>Images</b> module to select it (located in the Input modules panel on the left); this module is responsible for collecting
the names and locations of the files to be processed.</p>

<p>The most straightforward way to provide files to the <b>Images</b> module is
to simply drag-and-drop them from your file manager tool (e.g., Windows Explorer, Finder) onto the file list panel
(the blank space indicated by the text "Drop files and folders here").
Both individual files and entire folders can be dragged onto this panel, and as many folders and files can be
placed onto this panel as needed. As you add files, you will see a listing of the files appear in the panel.</p>

<p>CellProfiler supports a wide variety of image formats, including most of those used in imaging, by using a library called
Bio-Formats; see <a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5/supported-formats.html">here</a> for the formats available. Some image formats are better
than others for image analysis. Some are <a href="http://www.techterms.com/definition/lossy">"lossy"</a>
(information is lost in the conversion to the format) like most JPG/JPEG files; others are
<a href="http://www.techterms.com/definition/lossless">lossless</a> (no image information is lost). For image analysis purposes, a
lossless format like TIF or PNG is recommended.</p>

<p>If you have a subset of files that you want to analyze from the full list shown in the
panel, you can also filter the files according to a set of rules that you specify. This is useful when, for example, you
have dragged a folder of images onto the file list panel, but the folder contains the images
from one experiment that you want to process along with images from another experiment that you
want to ignore for now. You may specify as many rules as necessary to define the desired
list of images.</p>

<p>For more information on this module and how to configure it for the best performance, please see the detailed help by selecting the
module and clicking the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_HELP_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button at the bottom of the pipeline panel, or check out
the Input module tutorials on our <a href="http://cellprofiler.org/tutorials.html">Tutorials</a> page.</p>

    <tr align="center"><td><b>Groups</b></td><td>Define sub-divisions between groups of images for processing.</td><td>No</td>
    <td>For some assays, you will need the option of further sub-dividing an image set into <i>groups</i> that share a
    common feature. An example of this is a time-lapse movie that consists of individual files; each group of files that
    define a single movie needs to be processed independently of the others. This module allows you to specify what
    distinguishes one group of images from another. If your assay does not require this sort of behavior, this module
    can be safely skipped.</td></tr>

LOADING_IMAGE_SEQUENCES_HELP = """
<h3>Introdution</h3>
In this context, the term <i>image sequence</i> is used to refer to a collection of images which can be from
a time-lapse assay, a three-dimensional (3-D) Z-stack assay, or both. This section will instruct you how to load these collections
in order to properly represent your data for processing.

<h3>Sequences of individual files</h3>
<p>For some microscopes, the simplest method of capturing image sequences is to simply acquire them as a series of individual
images, where each image represents a single timepoint/z-slice (for simplicity, we will refer to <i>timepoints</i> in the rest of
this example). Typically, the image filename reflects
the timepoint, such that the alphabetical image listing corresponds to the proper sequence,
e.g., <i>img000.png</i>, <i>img001.png</i>, <i>img002.png</i>, etc</p>. It is also not uncommon
to store the movie such that one movie's worth of files is stored in a single folder.</p>
<p><i>Example:</i>You have a time-lapse movie of individual files set up as follows:
<ul>
<li>Three folders, one for each image channel, named <i>fluo2</i>, <i>fluor</i> and <i>phase</i>.</li>
<li>In each folder, the files are named as follows:
<ul>
<li><i>fluo2</i>: calibrate2-P01.001.TIF, calibrate2-P01.002.TIF,..., calibrate2-P01.287.TIF</li>
<li><i>fluor</i>: calibrated-P01.001.TIF, calibrated-P01.002.TIF,..., calibrated-P01.287.TIF</li>
<li><i>phase</i>: phase-P01.001.TIF, phase-P01.002.TIF,..., phase-P01.287.TIF</li>
</ul>
where the file names are in the format <i>&lt;Stain&gt;-&lt;Well&gt;.&lt;Timepoint&gt;.TIF</i>. </li>
<li>There are 287 timepoints per movie, and a movie of the 3 channels above is acquired from each well.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In this case, the procedure to set up the input modules to handle these files is as follows:
<ul>
<li>In the <b>Images</b> module, drag-and-drop your folders of images into the File list panel. If
necessary, set your rules accordingly in order to filter out any files that are not part of a movie
sequence.
<p>In the above example, you would drag-and-drop the <i>fluo2</i>, <i>fluor</i> and <i>phase</i> folders
into the File list panel.</p></li>
<li>In the <b>Metadata</b> module, check the box to enable metadata extraction. The key step here is to
obtain the metadata tags necessary to do two things:
<ul>
<li>Distinguish the movies from each other. This information is typically encapsulated in the filename
and/or the folder name.</li>
<li>For each movie, distinguish the timepoints from each other, ensuring their proper ordering. This information is usually contained
in the filename.</li>
</ul>
To accomplish this, do the following:
<ul>
<li>Select "%(X_MANUAL_EXTRACTION)s" or "%(X_IMPORTED_EXTRACTION)s" as the metadata extraction method. You
will use these to extract the movie and timepoint tags from the images. </li>
<li>Use "%(X_MANUAL_EXTRACTION)s" to create a regular expression to extract the metadata from the
filename and/or path name.</li>
<li>Or, use "%(X_IMPORTED_EXTRACTION)s" if you have a comma-delimted file (CSV) of the necessary
metadata columns (including the movie and timepoint tags) for each image.</li>
</ul>
If there are multiple channels for each movie, this step may need to be performed for each channel.
<p>In this example, you could do the following:
<ul>
<li>Select "%(X_MANUAL_EXTRACTION)s" as the method, "From file name" as the source, and
<code>.*-(?P&lt;Well&gt;[A-P][0-9]{2})\.(?P&lt;Timepoint&gt;[0-9]{3})</code> as the regular expression.
This step will extract the well ID and timepoint from each filename.</li>
<li>Click the "Add" button to add another extraction method.</i>
<li>In the new group of extraction settings, select "%(X_MANUAL_EXTRACTION)s" as the method, "From folder name" as the source, and
<code>.*[\\/](?P&lt;Stain>.*)[\\/].*$</code> as the regular expression.
This step will extract the stain name from each folder name.</li>
<li>Click the "Update" button below the divider and check the output in the table
to confirm that the proper metadata values are being collected from each image.</li>
</ul></p>
</li>
<li>In the <b>NamesAndTypes</b> module, assign the channel(s) to a name of your choice. If there are
multiple channels, you will need to do this for each channel.<br>
For this example, you could do the following:
<ul>
<li>Select "Assign images matching rules".</li>
<li>Make a new rule <code>[Metadata][Does][Have Stain matching][fluor]</code> and name it <i>OrigFluor</i>.
<li>Click the "Add" button to define another image with a rule.</li>
<li>Make a new rule <code>[Metadata][Does][Have Stain matching][fluo2]</code> and name it <i>OrigFluo2</i>.
<li>Click the "Add" button to define another image with a rule.</li>
<li>Make a new rule <code>[Metadata][Does][Have Stain matching][phase]</code> and name it <i>OrigPhase</i>.
<li>In the "Image set matching method" setting, select "Metadata".</li>
<li>Select "Well" for the <i>OrigFluor</i>, <i>OrigFluo2</i>, and <i>OrigPhase</i> channels.</li>
<li>Click the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button to the right to add another row,
and select "Timepoint" for each channel.</li>
<li>Click the "Update" button below the divider to view the resulting table and confirm that the proper
files are listed and matched across the channels. The corresponding well and frame for each channel
should now be matched to each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the <b>Groups</b> module, enable image grouping for these images in order to select the metadata
that defines a distinct movie of data.</br>
For the example above, do the following:
<ul>
<li>Select "Well" as the metadata category.</li>
<li>The tables below this setting will update themselves, and you should be able to visually confirm that
each well is defined as a group, each with 287 frames' worth of images.</li>
</ul>
Without this step, CellProfiler would not know where one movie ends and the next one begins, and would
process the images in all movies together as if they were constituents of only one movie.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Basic image sequences consisting of a single file</h3>
<p>Another common means of storing time-lapse/Z-stack data is as a single file containing the movie. Examples of this
approach include image formats such as:
<ul>
<li>Multi-frame TIF</li>
<li>Metamorph stack: STK</li>
<li>Evotec/PerkinElmer Opera Flex</li>
<li>Zeiss ZVI, LSM</li>
<li>Standard movie formats: AVI, Quicktime MOV, etc
</ul>
CellProfiler uses the Bio-Formats library for reading various image formats. For more details on
supported files, see this <a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats4/supported-formats.html">webpage</a>. In
general, we recommend saving stacks and movies in a format such as .TIF.
</p>

<p><i>Example:</i>You have two image stacks in the following format:
<ul>
<li>The stacks are Opera's FLEX format.</li>
<li>Each FLEX file contains 8 fields of view, with 3 channels at each site (DAPI, GFP, Texas Red). </li>
<li>Each channel is in grayscale format. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In this case, the procedure to set up the input modules to handle these files is as follows
(please note that this procedure is basically identical whether the file is for a time-lapse assay
or a Z-stack assay):
<ul>
<li>In the <b>Images</b> module, drag-and-drop your folders of images into the File list panel. If
necessary, set your rules accordingly in order to filter out any files that are not files that are not images to be processed.<br>
In the above example, you would drag-and-drop the FLEX files into the File list panel.</li>
<li>In the <b>Metadata</b> module, enable metadata extraction in order to obtain metadata from these files.
The key step here is to obtain the necessary metadata tags  to do two things:
<ul>
<li>Distinguish the stacks from each other. This information is contained as the file itself, that is,
each file represents a different stack.</li>
<li>For each stack, distinguish the frames from each other. This information is usually contained
in the image's internal metadata, in contrast to the image sequence described above.</li>
</ul>
To accomplish this, do the following:
<ul>
<li>Select "%(X_AUTOMATIC_EXTRACTION)s" as the metadata extraction method. In this case, CellProfiler will
extract the requisite information from the metadata stored in the image headers.</li>
<li>Click the "Update metadata" button. A progress bar will appear showing the time elapsed; depending on
the number of files present, this step may take a while to complete.</li>
<li>Click the "Update" button below the divider.</li>
<li>The resulting table should show the various metadata contained in the file. In this case, the relevant
information is contained in the <i>C</i> and <i>Series</i> columns. In the figure shown, the <i>C</i> column
shows three unique values for the channels represented, numbered from 0 to 2. The <i>Series</i> column shows
8 values for the slices collected in each stack, numbered from 0 to 7, followed by the slices for other stacks. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the <b>NamesAndTypes</b> module, assign the channel to a name of your choice. If there are multiple
channels, you will need to do this for each channel. For this example, you could do the following:
<ul>
<li>Select "Assign images matching rules".</li>
<li>Make a new rule <code>[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][0]</code> </li>
<li>Click the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button to the right of the rule to add another set of rules underneath.</li>
<li>Add the rule <code>[Image][Is][Stack frame]</code>. This
combination tells CellProfiler not to treat the image as a single file, but rather as a series of frames.</li>
<li>Name the image <i>DAPI</i>.</li>
<li>Click the "Add another image" button to define a second image with a set of rules. </li>
<li>Make a new rule <code>[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][1]</code>
<li>Click the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button to the right of the rule to add another set of rules underneath.</li>
<li>Add the rule <code>[Image][Is][Stack frame]</code>.</li>
<li>Name the image <i>GFP</i>.</li>
<li>Click the "Add another image" button to define a third image with a set of rules. </li>
<li>Make a new rule <code>[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][2]</code>
<li>Click the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button to the right of the rule to add another set of rules underneath.</li>
<li>Add the rule <code>[Image][Is][Stack frame]</code>.</li>
<li>Name the image <i>TxRed</i>.</li>
<li>In the "Image set matching method" setting, select "Metadata". </li>
<li>Select "FileLocation" for the DAPI, GFP and TxRed channels. The FileLocation metadata tag identifies the
individual stack, and selecting this parameter ensures that the channels are first matched within each
stack, rather than across stacks.</li>
<li>Click the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp; button to the right to add another row, and select <i>Series</i> for each channel. </li>
<li>Click the "Update" button below the divider to confirm that the proper image slices are listed and matched across the channels.
The corresponding <i>FileLocation</i> and <i>Series</i> for each channel should now be matched to each other.
</ul>

<li>In the <b>Groups</b> module, select the metadata that defines a distinct image stack. For the example above,
do the following:
<ul>
<li>Select "FileLocation" as the metadata category. </li>
<li>The tables below this setting will update themselves, and you should be able to visually confirm
that each of the two image stacks are defined as a group, each with 8 slices' worth of images. </li>
</ul>
Without this step, CellProfiler would not know where one stack ends and the next one begins, and would
process the slices in all stacks together as if they were constituents of only one stack.
</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Example:</i>You have two Z-stacks in the following format:
<ul>
<li>The stacks are in Zeiss' CZI format.</li>
<li>Each stack consists of a number of slices with 4 channels (DAPI, GFP, Texas Red and Cy3) at each slice. </li>
<li>One stack has 9 slices, two stacks have 7 slices and the fourth has 12 slices. Even though the stacks
were collected with differing numbers of slices, the pipeline to be constructed is intended to analyze all stacks in
the same manner.</li>
<li>Each slice is in grayscale format.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In this case, the procedure to set up the input modules to handle these this file is as follows
(please note that this procedure is basically identical whether the file is for a time-lapse assay
or a Z-stack assay):
<ul>
<li>In the <b>Images</b> module, drag-and-drop your folders of images into the File list panel. If
necessary, set your rules accordingly in order to filter out any files that are not images to be processed.<br>
In the above example, you would drag-and-drop the LSM files into the File list panel. In this case,
the default "Images only" filter is sufficient to capture the necessary files. </li>

<li>In the <b>Metadata</b> module, enable metadata extraction in order to obtain metadata from these
files. The key step here is to obtain the metadata tags necessary to do two things:
<ul>
<li>Distinguish the stacks from each other. This information is contained as the file itself, that is,
each file represents a different stack.</li>
<li>For each stack, distinguish the timepoints from each other, ensuring proper ordering. This information
is usually contained in the image file's internal metadata.</li>
</ul>
To accomplish this, do the following:
<ul>
<li>Select "%(X_AUTOMATIC_EXTRACTION)s" as the metadata extraction method. In this case, CellProfiler will
extract the requisite information from the metadata stored in the image headers.</li>
<li>Click the "Update metadata" button. A progress bar will appear showing the time elapsed; depending
on the number of files present, this step may take a while.</li>
<li>Click the "Update" button below the divider.</li>
<li>The resulting table should show the various metadata contained in the file. In this case, the relevant
information is contained in the C and Z columns. The <i>C</i> column shows four unique
values for the channels represented, numbered from 0 to 3. The <i>Z</i> column shows nine values for
the slices represented from the first stack, numbered from 0 to 8.</li>
<li>Of note in this case, for each file there is a single row summarizing this information. The <i>sizeC</i>
column reports a value of 4 and <i>sizeZ</i> column shows a value of 9. You may need to scroll down the table to
see this summary for the other stacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the <b>NamesAndTypes</b> module, assign the channel(s) to a name of your choice. If there are
multiple channels, you will need to do this for each channel.
<p>For the above example, you could do the following:
<ul>
<li>Select "Assign images matching rules".</li>
<li>Make a new rule <code>[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][0]</code> </li>
<li>Click the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button to the right of the rule to add another set of
rule options.</li>
<li>Add the rule <code>[Image][Is][Stack frame]</code>.</li>
<li>Name the image <i>DAPI</i>.
<li>Click the "Add another image" button to define a second image with a set of rules.</li>
<li>Make a new rule <code>[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][1]</code> </li>
<li>Click the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button to the right of the rule to add another set of
rule options.</li>
<li>Add the rule <code>[Image][Is][Stack frame]</code>.</li>
<li>Name the second image <i>GFP</i>.</li>
<li>Click the "Add another image" button to define a third image with a set of rules.</li>
<li>Make a new rule <code>[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][2]</code>.</li>
<li>Click the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button to the right of the rule to add another set of
rule options. </li>
<li>Add the rule <code>[Image][Is][Stack frame]</code>.</li>
<li>Name the third image <i>TxRed</i>. </li>
<li>Click the "Add another image" button to define a fourth image with set of rules.</li>
<li>Make a new rule <code>[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][3]</code>.</li>
<li>Click the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button to the right of the rule to add another set of
rule options. </li>
<li>Add the rule <code>[Image][Is][Stack frame]</code>.</li>
<li>Name the fourth image <i>Cy3</i>.</li>
<li>In the "Image set matching method" setting, select "Metadata".</li>
<li>Select "FileLocation" for the <i>DAPI</i>,<i>GFP</i>,<i>TxRed</i>, and <i>Cy3</i>channels. The
<i>FileLocation</i> identifies the individual
stack, and selecting this parameter insures that the channels are matched within each stack,
rather than across stacks.</li>
<li>Click the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button to the right to add another row,
and select "Z" for each channel.</li>
<li>Click "Update table" to confirm the channel matching. The corresponding <i>FileLocation</i> and <i>Z</i> for each
channel should be matched to each other.</li>
</ul></p>
</li>
<li>In the <b>Groups</b> module, select the metadata that defines a distinct image stack. For the example above,
do the following:

<li>Select "FileLocation" as the metadata category. </li>
