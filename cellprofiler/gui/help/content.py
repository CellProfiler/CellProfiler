LEGACY_LOAD_MODULES_HELP = u"""\
Historically, two modules served the same functionality as the current
project structure: **LoadImages** and **LoadData**. While the approach
described above supersedes these modules in part, old pipelines loaded
into CellProfiler that contain these modules will provide the option of
preserving them; these pipelines will operate exactly as before.

Alternately, the user can choose to convert these modules into the
project equivalent as closely as possible. Both modules remain accesible
via the “Add module” and |image0|  button at the bottom of the pipeline
panel. The section details information relevant for users who would like
to continue using these modules. Please note, however, that these
modules are deprecated and may be removed in the future.

Associating metadata with images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Metadata (i.e., additional data about image data) is sometimes available
for input images. This information can be:

#. Used by CellProfiler to group images with common metadata identifiers
   (or “tags”) together for particular steps in a pipeline;
#. Stored in the output file along with CellProfiler-measured features
   for annotation or sample-tracking purposes;
#. Used to name additional input/output files.

Two sources of metadata are:

-  *Metadata provided in the image filename or location (pathname).* For
   example, images produced by an automated microscope can be given
   names similar to “Experiment1\_A01\_w1\_s1.tif” in which the metadata
   about the plate (“Experiment1”), the well (“A01”), the wavelength
   number (“w1”) and the imaging site (“s1”) are encapsulated. The name
   of the folder in which the images are saved may be meaningful and may
   also be considered metadata as well. If this is the case for your
   data, use **LoadImages** to extract this information for use in the
   pipeline and storage in the output file.
-  *Metadata provided as a table of information*. Often, information
   associated with each image (such as treatment, plate, well, etc) is
   available as a separate spreadsheet. If this is the case for your
   data, use **LoadData** to load this information.

Details for the metadata-specific help is given next to the appropriate
settings in **LoadImages** and **LoadData**, as well the specific
settings in other modules which can make use of metadata. However, here
is an overview of how metadata is obtained and used.

In **LoadImages**, metadata can be extracted from the filename and/or
folder location using regular expression, a specialized syntax used for
text pattern-matching. These regular expressions can be used to identify
different parts of the filename / folder. The syntax
*(?P<fieldname>expr)* will extract whatever matches *expr* and assign it
to the image’s *fieldname* measurement. A regular expression tool is
available which will allow you to check the accuracy of your regular
expression.

For instance, say a researcher has folder names with the date and
subfolders containing the images with the run ID (e.g.,
*./2009\_10\_02/1234/*). The following regular expression will capture
the plate, well and site in the fields *Date* and *Run*:
``.\*[\\\\\\/](?P<Date>.\\*)[\\\\\\\\/](?P<Run>.\\*)$``

=============   ============
Subexpression   Explaination
=============   ============
.\\*[\\\\\\\\/]      Skip characters at the beginning of the pathname until either a slash (/) or backslash (\\\\) is encountered (depending on the OS). The extra slash for the backslash is used as an escape sequence.
(?P<Date>       Name the captured field *Date*
.\\*             Capture as many characters that follow
[\\\\\\\\/]         Discard the slash/backslash character
(?P<Run>        Name the captured field *Run*
$               The *Run* field must be at the end of the path string, i.e. the last folder on the path. This also means that the *Date* field contains the parent folder of the *Date* folder.=============   ============
=============   ============

In **LoadData**, metadata is extracted from a CSV (comma-separated) file
(a spreadsheet). Columns whose name begins with “Metadata” can be used
to group files loaded by **LoadData** that are associated with a common
metadata value. The files thus grouped together are then processed as a
distinct image set.

For instance, an experiment might require that images created on the
same day use an illumination correction function calculated from all
images from that day, and furthermore, that the date be captured in the
file names for the individual image sets and in a CSV file specifying
the illumination correction functions.

In this case, if the illumination correction images are loaded with the
**LoadData** module, the file should have a “Metadata\_Date” column
which contains the date metadata tags. Similarly, if the individual
images are loaded using the **LoadImages** module, **LoadImages** should
be set to extract the metadata tag from the file names. The pipeline
will then match the individual images with their corresponding
illumination correction functions based on matching “Metadata\_Date”
fields.

Using image grouping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use grouping, you must define the relevant metadata for each image.
This can be done using regular expressions in **LoadImages** or having
them pre-defined in a CSV file for use in **LoadData**.

To use image grouping in **LoadImages**, please note the following:

-  *Metadata tags must be specified for all images listed.* You cannot
   use grouping unless an appropriate regular expression is defined for
   all the images listed in the module.
-  *Shared metadata tags must be specified with the same name for each
   image listed.* For example, if you are grouping on the basis of a
   metadata tag “Plate” in one image channel, you must also specify the
   “Plate” metadata tag in the regular expression for the other channels
   that you want grouped together.

})

USING_THE_OUTPUT_FILE_HELP = u"""\
Please note that the output file will be deprecated in the future. This
setting is temporarily present for those needing HDF5 or MATLAB formats,
and will be moved to Export modules in future versions of CellProfiler.

The *output file* is a file where all information about the analysis as
well as any measurements will be stored to the hard drive. **Important
note:** This file does *not* provide the same functionality as the
Export modules. If you want to produce a spreadsheet of measurements
easily readable by Excel or a database viewer (or similar programs),
please refer to the **ExportToSpreadsheet** or **ExportToDatabase**
modules and the associated help.

The options associated with the output file are accessible by pressing
the “View output settings” button at the bottom of the pipeline panel.
In the settings panel to the left, in the *Output Filename* box, you can
specify the name of the output file.

The output file can be written in one of two formats:

-  A *.mat file* which is readable by CellProfiler and by `MATLAB`_
   (Mathworks).
-  An *.h5 file* which is readable by CellProfiler, MATLAB and any other
   program capable of reading the HDF5 data format. Documentation on how
   measurements are stored and handled in CellProfiler using this format
   can be found `here`_.

Results in the output file can also be accessed or exported using **Data
Tools** from the main menu of CellProfiler. The pipeline with its
settings can be be loaded from an output file using *File > Load
Pipeline…*

The output file will be saved in the Default Output Folder unless you
type a full path and file name into the file name box. The path must not
have spaces or characters disallowed by your computer’s platform.

If the output filename ends in *OUT.mat* (the typical text appended to
an output filename), CellProfiler will prevent you from overwriting this
file on a subsequent run by generating a new file name and asking if you
want to use it instead. You can override this behavior by checking the
*Allow overwrite?* box to the right.

For analysis runs that generate a large number of measurements, you may
notice that even though the analysis completes, CellProfiler continues
to use an inordinate amount of your CPU and RAM. This is because the
output file is written after the analysis is completed and can take a
very long time for a lot of measurements. If you do not need this file
and/or notice this behavior, select "*Do not write measurements*" from
the “Measurements file format” drop-down box.

WHEN_CAN_I_USE_CELLPROFILER_HELP = u"""\
Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use
light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological
samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze
these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be
examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly
quantitative and complex.

CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying
data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput
experiments. CellProfiler is designed for modular, flexible,
high-throughput analysis of images, measuring size, shape, intensity,
and texture of every cell (or other object) in every image. Using the
point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI), users construct an image
analysis “pipeline”, a sequential series of modules that each perform an
image processing function such as illumination correction, object
identification (segmentation), and object measurement. Users mix and
match modules and adjust their settings to measure the phenotype of
interest. While originally designed for high-throughput images, it is
equally appropriate for low-throughput assays as well (i.e., assays of <
100 images).

CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images
quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of
assays. It helps researchers approach a variety of biological questions
quantitatively, including standard assays (e.g., cell count, size,
per-cell protein levels) as well as complex morphological assays (e.g.,
cell/organelle shape or subcellular patterns of DNA or protein
staining).

The wide variety of measurements produced by CellProfiler serves as
useful “raw material” for machine learning algorithms. CellProfiler’s
companion software, CellProfiler Analyst, has an interactive machine
learning tool called Classifier which can learn to recognize a phenotype
of interest based on your guidance. Once you complete the training
phase, CellProfiler Analyst will score every object in your images based
on CellProfiler’s measurements. CellProfiler Analyst also contains tools
for the interactive visualization of the data produced by CellProfiler.

In summary, CellProfiler contains:

-  Advanced algorithms for image analysis that are able to accurately
   identify crowded cells and non-mammalian cell types.
-  A modular, flexible design allowing analysis of new assays and
   phenotypes.
-  Open-source code so the underlying methodology is known and can be
   modified or improved by others.
-  A user-friendly interface.
-  The capability to make use of clusters of computers when available.
-  A design that eliminates the tedium of the many steps typically
   involved in image analysis, many of which are not easily transferable
   from one project to another (for example, image formatting, combining
   several image analysis steps, or repeating the analysis with slightly
   different parameters).

BUILDING_A_PIPELINE_HELP = u"""\
A *pipeline* is a sequential set of image analysis modules. The best way
to learn how to use CellProfiler is to load an example pipeline from the
CellProfiler website’s Examples page and try it out, then adapt it for
your own images. You can also build a pipeline from scratch. Click the
*Help* |image0|  button in the main window to get help for a specific
module.

Loading an existing pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Put the images and pipeline into a folder on your computer.
#. Set the Default Output Folder (press the “View output settings”) to
   the folder where you want to place your output (preferably a
   different location than in the input images).
#. Load the pipeline using *File > Import Pipeline > From File…* in the
   main menu of CellProfiler.
#. Click the *Analyze Images* button to start processing.
#. Examine the measurements using *Data tools*. The *Data tools* options
   are accessible in the main menu of CellProfiler and allow you to
   plot, view, or export your measurements (e.g., to Excel).
#. If you modify the modules or settings in the pipeline, you can save
   the pipeline using *File > Export > Pipeline…*. Alternately, you can
   save the project as a whole using *File > Save Project* or *Save
   Project As…* which also saves the file list.
#. To learn how to use a cluster of computers to process large batches
   of images, see *{BATCH_PROCESSING_HELP_REF}*.

Building a pipeline from scratch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Constructing a pipeline involves placing individual modules into a
pipeline. The list of modules in the pipeline is shown in the *pipeline
panel* (located on the left-hand side of the CellProfiler window).

#. *Place analysis modules in a new pipeline.*

   Choose image analysis modules to add to your pipeline by clicking the
   *Add* |image1| button (located underneath the pipeline panel) or
   right-clicking in the pipeline panel itself and selecting a module
   from the pop-up box that appears.

   You can learn more about each module by clicking *Module Help* in the
   “Add modules” window or the *?* button after the module has been
   placed and selected in the pipeline. Modules are added to the end of
   the pipeline or after the currently selected module, but you can
   adjust their order in the main window by dragging and dropping them,
   or by selecting a module (or modules, using the *Shift* key) and
   using the *Move Module Up* |image2| and *Move Module Down*
   |image3| buttons. The *Remove Module* |image4| button will delete the
   selected module(s) from the pipeline.

   Most pipelines depend on one major step: identifying the objects. In
   CellProfiler, the objects you identify are called *primary*,
   *secondary*, or *tertiary*:

   -  **IdentifyPrimary** modules identify objects without relying on
      any information other than a single grayscale input image (e.g.,
      nuclei are typically primary objects).
   -  **IdentifySecondaryObjects** modules require a grayscale image
      plus an image where primary objects have already been identified,
      because the secondary objects are determined based on the primary
      objects (e.g., cells can be secondary objects when their
      identification is based on the location of nuclei).
   -  **IdentifyTertiary** modules require images in which two sets of
      objects have already been identified (e.g., nuclei and cell
      regions are used to define the cytoplasm objects, which are
      tertiary objects).

#. *Adjust the settings in each module.*

   In the CellProfiler main window, click a module in the pipeline to
   see its settings in the settings panel. To learn more about the
   settings for each module, select the module in the pipeline and
   click the *Help* button to the right of each setting, or at the
   bottom of the pipeline panel for the help for all the settings for
   that module.

   If there is an error with the settings (e.g., a setting refers to an
   image that doesn’t exist yet), a |image5| icon will appear next to the
   module name. If there is a warning (e.g., a special notification
   attached to a choice of setting), a |image6| icon will appear. Errors
   will cause the pipeline to fail upon running, whereas a warning will
   not. Once the errors/warnings have been resolved, a |image7|  icon will
   appear indicating that the module is ready to run.

#. *Set your Default Input Folder, Default Output Folder and output
   filename.*

   For more help, click their nearby *Help* buttons in the main
   window.

#. *Click *Analyze images* to start processing.*

   All of the images in your selected folder(s) will be analyzed using
   the modules and settings you have specified. A status window will
   appear which has the following:

   -  A *progress bar* which gives the elapsed time and estimates the
      time remaining to process the full image set.
   -  A *pause button* |image8|  which pauses execution and allows you
      to subsequently resume the analysis.
   -  A *stop button* |image9|  which cancels execution after prompting
      you for a place to save the measurements collected to that point.
   -  A *save measurements* button |image10|  which will prompt you for a
      place to save the measurements collected to that point while
      continuing the analysis run.

   At the end of each cycle, CellProfiler saves the measurements in the
   output file.

#. *Click *Start Test Mode* to preview results.*

   You can optimize your pipeline by selecting the *Test* option from
   the main menu. Test mode allows you to run the pipeline on a
   selected image, preview the results, and adjust the module settings
   on the fly. See *{TEST_MODE_HELP_REF}* for more details.

#. Save your project (which includes your pipeline) via *File > Save
   Project*.

*Saving images in your pipeline:* Due to the typically high number of
intermediate images produced during processing, images produced during
processing are not saved to the hard drive unless you specifically
request it, using a **SaveImages** module.

*Saving data in your pipeline:* You can include an **Export** module to
automatically export data in a format you prefer. See
*{USING_YOUR_OUTPUT_REF}* for more details.

SPREADSHEETS_DATABASE_HELP = u"""\
The most common form of output for cellular analysis is a *spreadsheet*,
which is an application which tabulates data values. CellProfiler can
also output data into a *database*, which is a collection of data that
is stored for retrieval by users. Which format you use will depend on
some of the considerations below:

-  *Assessibility:* Spreadsheet applications are typically designed to
   allow easy user interaction with the data, to edit values, make
   graphs and the like. In contrast, the values in databases are
   typically not modified after the fact. Instead, database applications
   typically allow for viewing a specific data range.
-  *Capacity and speed:* Databases are designed to hold larger amounts
   of data than spreadsheets. Spreadsheets may contain hundreds to a few
   thousand rows of data, whereas databases can hold mnay millions of
   rows of data. Due to the high capacity, accessing a particular
   portion of data in a database is optimized for speed.
-  *Learning curve:* The applications that access spreadsheets are
   usually made for ease-of-use to allow for user edits. Databases are
   more sophisticated and are not typically edited or modified; to do so
   require knowledge of specialized languages made for this purpose
   (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, etc).

For spreadsheets, the most widely used program to open these files is
Microsoft’s Excel program. Since the file is plain text, other editors
can also be used, such as `Calc`_ or `Google Docs`_. For databases, a
popular freeware access tool is `SQLyog`_.

"""

TEST_MODE_HELP = u"""\
Before starting an analysis run, you can test the pipeline settings on a
selected image cycle using the *Test* mode option on the main menu. Test
mode allows you to run the pipeline on a selected image, preview the
results and adjust the module settings on the fly.

To enter Test mode once you have built a pipeline, choose *Test > Start
Test Mode* from the menu bar in the main window. At this point, you will
see the following features appear:

-  The module view will have a slider bar appearing on the far left.
-  A Pause icon |image0|  will appear to the left of each module.
-  A series of buttons will appear at the bottom of the pipeline panel
   above the module adjustment buttons.
-  The grayed-out items in the *Test* menu will become active, and the
   *Analyze Images* button will become inactive.

You can run your pipeline in Test mode by selecting *Test > Step to Next
Module* or clicking the *Run* or *Step* buttons at the bottom of the
pipeline panel. The pipeline will execute normally, but you will be able
to back up to a previous module or jump to a downstream module, change
module settings to see the results, or execute the pipeline on the image
of your choice. The additional controls allow you to do the following:

-  *Slider:* Start/resume execution of the pipeline at any time by
   moving the slider. However, if the selected module depends on objects
   and/or images generated by prior modules, you will see an error
   message indicating that the data has not been produced yet. To avoid
   this, it is best to actually run the pipeline up to the module of
   interest, and move the slider to modules already executed.
-  *Pause:* Clicking the pause icon will cause the pipeline test run to
   halt execution when that module is reached (the paused module itself
   is not executed). The icon changes from |image1| to |image2| to
   indicate that a pause has been inserted at that point.
-  *Run:* Execution of the pipeline will be started/resumed until the
   next module pause is reached. When all modules have been executed for
   a given image cycle, execution will stop.
-  *Step:* Execute the next module (as indicated by the slider
   location).
-  *Next Image:* Skip ahead to the next image cycle as determined by the
   image order in the Input modules. The slider will automatically
   return to the first module in the pipeline.

From the *Test* menu, you can choose additional options:

-  *Exit Test Mode:* Exit *Test* mode. Loading a new pipeline or
   adding/subtracting modules will also automatically exit test mode.
-  *Step to Next Module:* Execute the next module (as indicated by the
   slider location)
-  *Next Image Set:* Step to the next image set in the current image
   group.
-  *Next Image Group:* Step to the next group in the image set. The
   slider will then automatically return to the first module in the
   pipeline.
-  *Random Image Set:* Randomly select and jump to an image set in the
   current image group.
-  *Choose Image Set:* Choose the image set to jump to. The slider will
   then automatically return to the first module in the pipeline.
-  *Choose Image Group:* Choose an image group to jump to. The slider
   will then automatically return to the first module in the pipeline.
-  *Reload Modules Source (enabled only if running from source code):*
   This option will reload the module source code, so any changes to the
   code will be reflected immediately.

Note that if movies are being loaded, the individual movie is defined as
a group automatically. Selecting *Choose Image Group* will allow you to
choose the movie file, and *Choose Image Set* will let you choose the
individual movie frame from that file.

Please see the **Groups** module for more details on the proper use of
metadata for grouping.

BATCHPROCESSING_HELP = u"""\
CellProfiler is designed to analyze images in a high-throughput manner.
Once a pipeline has been established for a set of images, CellProfiler
can export batches of images to be analyzed on a computing cluster with
the pipeline.

It is possible to process tens or even hundreds of thousands of images
for one analysis in this manner. We do this by breaking the entire set
of images into separate batches, then submitting each of these batches
as individual jobs to a cluster. Each individual batch can be separately
analyzed from the rest.

Submitting files for batch processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is a basic workflow for submitting your image batches to the
cluster.

#. *Create a folder for your project on your cluster.* For
   high-throughput analysis, it is recommended to create a separate
   project folder for each run.
#. Within this project folder, create the following folders (both of
   which must be connected to the cluster computing network):

   -  Create an input folder, then transfer all of your images to this
      folder as the input folder. The input folder must be readable by
      everyone (or at least your cluster) because each of the separate
      cluster computers will read input files from this folder.
   -  Create an output folder where all your output data will be stored.
      The output folder must be writeable by everyone (or at least your
      cluster) because each of the separate cluster computers will write
      output files to this folder.

   If you cannot create folders and set read/write permissions to these
   folders (or don’t know how), ask your Information Technology (IT)
   department for help.
#. Press the “{VIEW_OUTPUT_SETTINGS_BUTTON_NAME}” button. In the
   panel that appears, set the Default Input and Default Output Folders
   to the *images* and *output* folders created above, respectively. The
   Default Input Folder setting will only appear if a legacy pipeline is
   being run.
#. *Create a pipeline for your image set.* You should test it on a few
   example images from your image set (if you are unfamilar with the
   concept of an image set, please see the help for the **Input**
   modules). The module settings selected for your pipeline will be
   applied to *all* your images, but the results may vary depending on
   the image quality, so it is critical to insure that your settings be
   robust against your “worst-case” images.
   For instance, some images may contain no cells. If this happens, the
   automatic thresholding algorithms will incorrectly choose a very low
   threshold, and therefore “find” spurious objects. This can be
   overcome by setting a lower limit on the threshold in the
   **IdentifyPrimaryObjects** module.
   The Test mode in CellProfiler may be used for previewing the results
   of your settings on images of your choice. Please refer to
   *{TEST_MODE_HELP_REF}* for more details on how to use this
   utility.
#. *Add the CreateBatchFiles module to the end of your pipeline.*
   This module is needed to resolve the pathnames to your files with
   respect to your local machine and the cluster computers. If you are
   processing large batches of images, you may also consider adding
   **ExportToDatabase** to your pipeline, after your measurement modules
   but before the CreateBatchFiles module. This module will export your
   data either directly to a MySQL/SQLite database or into a set of
   comma-separated files (CSV) along with a script to import your data
   into a MySQL database. Please refer to the help for these modules in
   order learn more about which settings are appropriate.
#. *Run the pipeline to create a batch file.* Click the *Analyze images*
   button and the analysis will begin processing locally. Do not be
   surprised if this initial step takes a while since CellProfiler must
   first create the entire image set list based on your settings in the
   **Input** modules (this process can be sped up by creating your list
   of images as a CSV and using the **LoadData** module to load it).
   With the **CreateBatchFiles** module in place, the pipeline will not
   process all the images, but instead will creates a batch file (a file
   called *Batch\_data.h5*) and save it in the Default Output Folder
   (Step 1). The advantage of using **CreateBatchFiles** from the
   researcher’s perspective is that the Batch\_data.h5 file generated by
   the module captures all of the data needed to run the analysis. You
   are now ready to submit this batch file to the cluster to run each of
   the batches of images on different computers on the cluster.
#. *Submit your batches to the cluster.* Log on to your cluster, and
   navigate to the directory where you have installed CellProfiler on
   the cluster.
   A single batch can be submitted with the following command:

   .. code-block::

      ./python -m cellprofiler -p <Default_Output_Folder_path>/Batch_data.h5 \\
      -c -r -b \\
      -f <first_image_set_number> \\
      -l <last_image_set_number>

   This command submits the batch file to CellProfiler and specifies
   that CellProfiler run in a batch mode without its user interface to
   process the pipeline. This run can be modified by using additional
   options to CellProfiler that specify the following:

   -  ``-p <Default_Output_Folder_path>/Batch_data.h5``: The
      location of the batch file, where ``<Default\_Output\_Folder\_path>``
      is the output folder path as seen by the cluster computer.
   -  ``-c``: Run “headless”, i.e., without the GUI
   -  ``-r``: Run the pipeline specified on startup, which is contained
      in the batch file.
   -  ``-b``: Do not build extensions, since by this point, they should
      already be built.
   -  ``-f <first_image_set_number>``: Start processing with the image
      set specified, <first\_image\_set\_number>
   -  ``-l <last_image_set_number>``: Finish processing with the image
      set specified, <last\_image\_set\_number>

   Typically, a user will break a long image set list into pieces and
   execute each of these pieces using the command line switches, ``-f``
   and ``-l`` to specify the first and last image sets in each job. A
   full image set would then need a script that calls CellProfiler with
   these options with sequential image set numbers, e.g, 1-50, 51-100,
   etc to submit each as an individual job.

   If you need help in producing the batch commands for submitting your
   jobs, use the ``--get-batch-commands`` along with the ``-p`` switch to
   specify the Batch\_data.h5 file output by the CreateBatchFiles module.
   When specified, CellProfiler will output one line to the terminal per
   job to be run. This output should be further processed to generate a
   script that can invoke the jobs in a cluster-computing context.

   The above notes assume that you are running CellProfiler using our
   source code (see “Developer’s Guide” under Help for more details). If
   you are using the compiled version, you would replace
   ``./python -m cellprofiler`` with the CellProfiler executable
   file itself and run it from the installation folder.

Once all the jobs are submitted, the cluster will run each batch
individually and output any measurements or images specified in the
pipeline. Specifying the output filename using the ``-o`` switch when
calling CellProfiler will also produce an output file containing the
measurements for that batch of images in the output folder. Check the
output from the batch processes to make sure all batches complete.
Batches that fail for transient reasons can be resubmitted.

``cellprofiler --help`` to see a listing.

RUN_MULTIPLE_PIPELINES_HELP = u"""\
The **Run multiple pipelines** dialog lets you select several
pipelines which will be run consecutively. Please note the following:

-  CellProfiler 2.1 project files are not currently supported.
-  Pipelines from CellProfiler 2.0 and lower are supported.
-  If you want to use a pipeline made using CellProfiler 2.1, then you
   need to include the project file list with the pipeline, by selecting
   *Export > Pipeline…*, and under the “Save as type” dropdown, select
   “CellProfiler pipeline and file list”.

You can invoke **Run multiple pipelines** by selecting it from thefile menu. The dialog has three parts to it:

-  *File chooser*: The file chooser lets you select the pipeline files
   to be run. The *Select all* and *Deselect all* buttons to the right
   will select or deselect all pipeline files in the list. The *Add*
   button will add the pipelines to the pipeline list. You can add a
   pipeline file multiple times, for instance if you want to run that
   pipeline on more than one input folder.
-  *Directory chooser*: The directory chooser lets you navigate to
   different directories. The file chooser displays all pipeline files
   in the directory chooser’s current directory.
-  *Pipeline list*: The pipeline list has the pipelines to be run in the
   order that they will be run. Each pipeline has a default input and
   output folder and a measurements file. You can change any of these by
   clicking on the file name - an appropriate dialog will then be
   displayed. You can click the remove button to remove a pipeline from
   the list

CellProfiler will run all of the pipelines on the list when you hit
the “OK” button.
"""

CONFIGURING_LOGGING_HELP = u"""\
CellProfiler prints diagnostic messages to the console by default. You
can change this behavior for most messages by configuring logging. The
simplest way to do this is to use the command-line switch, “-L”, to
set the log level. For instance, to show error messages or more
critical events, start CellProfiler like this:
``CellProfiler -L ERROR``
The following is a list of log levels that can be used:

-  **DEBUG:** Detailed diagnostic information
-  **INFO:** Informational messages that confirm normal progress
-  **WARNING:** Messages that report problems that might need attention
-  **ERROR:** Messages that report unrecoverable errors that result in
   data loss or termination of the current operation.
-  **CRITICAL:** Messages indicating that CellProfiler should be
   restarted or is incapable of running.

You can tailor CellProfiler’s logging with much more control using a
logging configuration file. You specify the file name in place of the
log level on the command line, like this:

``CellProfiler -L ~/CellProfiler/my_log_config.cfg``

Files are in the Microsoft .ini format which is grouped into
categories enclosed in square brackets and the key/value pairs for
each category. Here is an example file:

::

    [loggers]
    keys=root,pipelinestatistics

    [handlers]
    keys=console,logfile

    [formatters]
    keys=detailed

    [logger_root]
    level=WARNING
    handlers=console

    [logger_pipelinestatistics]
    level=INFO
    handlers=logfile
    qualname=pipelineStatistics
    propagate=0

    [handler_console]
    class=StreamHandler
    formatter=detailed
    level=WARNING
    args=(sys.stderr)

    [handler_logfile]
    class=FileHandler
    level=INFO
    args=('~/CellProfiler/logfile.log','w')

    [formatter_detailed]
    format=[%(asctime)s] %(name)s %(levelname)s %(message)s
    datefmt=

The above file would print warnings and errors to the console for all
messages but “pipeline statistics” which are configured using the
*pipelineStatistics* logger are written to a file instead.. The
pipelineStatistics logger is the logger that is used to print progress
messages when the pipeline is run. You can find out which loggers are
being used to write particular messages by printing all messages with a
formatter that prints the logger name (“%(name)s”).
The format of the file is described in greater detail `here`_.

"""

ACCESSING_OMERO_IMAGES = u"""\
CellProfiler has first-class support for loading images from `OMERO`_.
The input modules and the LoadData module can refer to images by URL,
for instance, the example pipeline on the welcome page loads its images
from ``http://cellprofiler.org/ExampleFlyImages``. The first part of a
URL (the part before the colon) is the schema. CellProfiler decides
which communication protocol to use, depending on the schema; in the
case of the example on the welcome page, the schema is HTTP and
CellProfiler uses the HTTP protocol to get the image data. For OMERO,
the schema that should be used is “omero” and we use the OMERO client
library to fetch and load the data.

OMERO URLs have the form, “omero:iid=”. You can find the image IDs
using either the OMERO web client or the `Insight software`_. As an
example, the screen capture below indicates that the image,
“Channel1-01-A-01.tif”, has an IID of 58038:

|image0|

At present, manually curating the URL list can be somewhat
time-consuming, but we are planning to develop plug-ins for Insight that
will automatically generate these lists for CellProfiler from within the
Insight user interface. The plugin will allow you to select a screen or
plate and export an image set list that can be used with CellProfiler’s
LoadData module.

OMERO login credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CellProfiler will ask you for your OMERO login credentials when you
first access an OMERO URL, either by viewing it from the file list or
by loading it in a pipeline. CellProfiler will create and maintain a
session for you based on these credentials until you close the
application. You should only need to enter your credentials once. To
use the “Log into Omero” dialog, enter your server’s name or IP
address, the port (usually 4064), your user name and password and
press the “Connect” button. The “Connect” button should turn green and
the OK button of the dialog should become enabled (see below). Press
OK to complete the login.

|image1|

Currently, CellProfiler cannot establish a connection to OMERO when
running headless - to do that, we would need to store the user password
where it might be otherwise visible. We would like to provide a secure
mechanism for establishing a session when headless and would like to
work with you to make this work in your environment; please contact us
for further information on how to modify CellProfiler yourself to do
this or with suggestions for us to implement.

Using OMERO URLs with the Input modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Images** module has a file list panel of all of the image files in
a project. This file list supports URLs including OMERO URLs. You can
drag URLs from a text document and drop them into the file list. The
URLs do not end with image file extensions (like .TIF), so you need to
change the “Filter images?” setting to “No filtering” to allow the OMERO
URLs to be processed further. You should be able to view the image by
double-clicking on it and you should be able to extract plate, well,
site and channel name metadata from each image using the “Extract from
image file headers” method in the **Metadata** module (press the “Update
Metadata” button after selecting the “Extract from image file headers”
method). If your experiment has more than one image channel, you can use
the “ChannelName” metadata extracted from the OMERO image to create
image sets containing all of your image channels. In the
**NamesAndTypes** module, change the “Assign a name to” setting to
“Images matching rules”. For the rule criteria, select “Metadata does
have ChannelName matching” and enter the name that appears under
“Channels” in the OMERO Insight browser. Add additional channels to
**NamesAndTypes** using the “Add another image” button.

OMERO URLs and LoadData
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LoadData module reads image sets from a .CSV file. The CSV file has
a one-line header that tells LoadData how to use each of the columns of
the file. You can load channels from a URL by adding a “URL” tag to this
header. The OMERO URLs themselves appear in rows below. For instance,
here is a .CSV that loads a DNA and GFP channel:

::

    URL_DNA,URL_GFP
    omero:iid=58134,omero:iid=58038
    omero:iid=58135,omero:iid=58039

MEASUREMENT_NOMENCLATURE_HELP = u"""\
In CellProfiler, measurements are exported as well as stored internally
using the following general nomenclature:
``MeasurementType_Category_SpecificFeatureName_Parameters``

Below is the description for each of the terms:

-  ``MeasurementType``: The type of data contained in the measurement,
   which can be one of three forms:

   -  *Per-image:* These measurements are image-based (e.g., thresholds,
      counts) and are specified with the name “Image” or with the
      measurement (e.g., “Mean”) for per-object measurements aggregated
      over an image.
   -  *Per-object:* These measurements are per-object and are specified
      as the name given by the user to the identified objects (e.g.,
      “Nuclei” or “Cells”)
   -  *Experiment:* These measurements are produced for a particular
      measurement across the entire analysis run (e.g., Z’-factors), and
      are specified with the name “Experiment”. See
      **CalculateStatistics** for an example.

-  ``Category:`` Typically, this information is specified in one of two
   ways

   -  A descriptive name indicative of the type of measurement taken
      (e.g., “Intensity”)
   -  No name if there is no appropriate ``Category`` (e.g., if the
      *SpecificFeatureName* is “Count”, no ``Category`` is specfied).

-  ``SpecificFeatureName:`` The specific feature recorded by a module
   (e.g., “Perimeter”). Usually the module recording the measurement
   assigns this name, but a few modules allow the user to type in the
   name of the feature (e.g., the **CalculateMath** module allows the
   user to name the arithmetic measurement).
-  ``Parameters:`` This specifier is to distinguish measurements
   obtained from the same objects but in different ways. For example,
   **MeasureObjectIntensity** can measure intensities for “Nuclei” in
   two different images. This specifier is used primarily for data
   obtained from an individual image channel specified by the **Images**
   module or a legacy **Load** module (e.g., “OrigBlue” and “OrigGreen”)
   or a particular spatial scale (e.g., under the category “Texture” or
   “Neighbors”). Multiple parameters are separated by underscores.

   Below are additional details specific to various modules:

   -  Measurements from the *AreaShape* and *Math* categories do not
      have a ``Parameter`` specifier.
   -  Measurements from *Intensity*, *Granularity*, *Children*,
      *RadialDistribution*, *Parent* and *AreaOccupied* categories will
      have an associated image as the Parameter.
   -  *Measurements from the *Neighbors* and *Texture* category will
      have a spatial scale ``Parameter``.*
   -  Measurements from the *Texture* and *RadialDistribution*
      categories will have both a spatial scale and an image
      ``Parameter``.

As an example, consider a measurement specified as
``Nuclei_Texture_DifferenceVariance_ER_3``:

-  ``MeasurementType`` is “Nuclei,” the name given to the detected
   objects by the user.
-  ``Category`` is “Texture,” indicating that the module
   **MeasureTexture** produced the measurements.
-  ``SpecificFeatureName`` is “DifferenceVariance,” which is one of the
   many texture measurements made by the **MeasureTexture** module.
-  There are two ``Parameters``, the first of which is “ER”. “ER” is the
   user-provided name of the image in which this texture measurement was
   made.
-  The second ``Parameter`` is “3”, which is the spatial scale at which
   this texture measurement was made.

See also the *Available measurements* heading under the main help for
many of the modules, as well as **ExportToSpreadsheet** and
**ExportToDatabase** modules.

The *Data Tools* menu provides tools to allow you to plot, view, export
or perform specialized analyses on your measurements.

Each data tool has a corresponding module with the same name and
functionality. The difference between the data tool and the module is
that the data tool takes a CellProfiler output file (i.e., a *.mat or
.h5* file) as input, which contains measurements from a previously
completed analysis run. In contrast, a module uses measurements received
from the upstream modules during an in-progress analysis run.

Opening a data tool will present a prompt in which the user is asked to
provide the location of the output file. Once specified, the user is
then prompted to enter the desired settings. The settings behave
identically as those from the corresponding module.

Help for each *Data Tool* is available under *{DATA_TOOL_HELP_REF}*

      this will save the entire contents of the window, not just the
      individual subplot(s) or images.
   -  *Save table:* This option is only enabled on windows which are
      displaying tabular output, such as that from a **Measure** module.
      This allows you to save the tabular data to a comma-delimited file
      (CSV).

-  **Tools**

   *Back* |image2| buttons are akin to the web browser forward and back
   buttons in that they are used to navigate back and forth between
   previously defined views, one step at a time. They will not be
   enabled unless you have already navigated within an image else using
   the **Pan** and **Zoom** buttons, which are used to define new views.
-  **Pan/Zoom button:** This button has two modes: pan and zoom. Click
   the toolbar button |image3| to activate panning and zooming, then put
   your mouse somewhere over an axes, where it will turn into a hand
   icon.

   -  *Pan:* Press the left mouse button and hold it to pan the figure,
      dragging it to a new position. Press Ctrl+Shift with the pan tool
      to move in one axis only, which one you have moved farther on.
      Keep in mind that that this button will allow you pan outside the
      bounds of the image; if you get lost, you can always use the
      **Home** to back you back to the initial view.
   -  *Zoom:* You can zoom in and out of a plot by pressing Ctrl (Mac)
      or holding down the right mouse button (Windows) while panning.
      Once you’re done, the right click menu will pop up when you’re
      done with the action; dismiss it by clicking off the plot. This is

Right-clicking in an image displayed in a window will bring up a pop-up
menu with the following options:

-  *Open image in new window:* Displays the image in a new display
   window. This is useful for getting a closer look at a window subplot
   that has a small image.
-  *Show image histogram:* Produces a new window containing a histogram
   of the pixel intensities in the image. This is useful for
   qualitatively examining whether a threshold value determined by
   **IdentifyPrimaryObjects** seems reasonable, for example. Image
   intensities in CellProfiler typically range from zero (dark) to one
   (bright). If you have an RGB image, the histogram shows the intensity
   values for all three channels combined, even if one or more channels
   is turned off for viewing.
-  *Image contrast:* Presents three options for displaying the
   color/intensity values in the images:

      -  *Raw:* Shows the image using the full colormap range permissible for
         the image type. For example, for a 16-bit image, the pixel data will
         be shown using 0 as black and 65535 as white. However, if the actual
         pixel intensities span only a portion of the image intensity range,
         this may render the image unviewable. For example, if a 16-bit image
         only contains 12 bits of data, the resulting image will be entirely
         black.
      -  *Normalized (default):* Shows the image with the colormap
         “autoscaled” to the maximum and minimum pixel intensity values; the
         minimum value is black and the maximum value is white.
      -  *Log normalized:* Same as *Normalized* except that the color values
         are then log transformed. This is useful for when the pixel intensity
         spans a wide range of values but the standard deviation is small
         (e.g., the majority of the interesting information is located at the
         dim values). Using this option increases the effective contrast.

-  *Interpolation:* Presents three options for displaying the resolution
   in the images. This is useful for specifying the amount of detail
   that you want to be visible if you zoom in:

      -  *Nearest neighbor:* Use the intensity of the nearest image pixel when
         displaying screen pixels at sub-pixel resolution. This produces a
         blocky image, but the image accurately reflects the data.
      -  *Linear:* Use the weighted average of the four nearest image pixels
         when displaying screen pixels at sub-pixel resolution. This produces
         a smoother, more visually-appealing image, but makes it more
         difficult to find pixel borders.
      -  *Cubic:* Perform a bicubic interpolation of the nearby image pixels
         when displaying screen pixels at sub-pixel resolution. This produces
         the most visually-appealing image but is the least faithful to the
         image pixel values.

-  *Save subplot:* Save the clicked subplot as an image file. If there
   is only one p lot in the figure, this option will save that one.
-  *Channels:* For color images only. You can show any combination of
   the red, green, and blue color channels.

What is a project?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In CellProfiler, a *project* is comprised of two elements:

-  An *image file list* which is the list of files and their locations
   that are selected by the user as candidates for analysis.
-  The *pipeline*, which is a series of modules put together used to
   analyze a set of images.
-  Optionally, the associated information about the images (*metadata*).
   This information may be part of the images themselves, or imported
   externally by the user.

The project is the container for image information associated with a
CellProfiler analysis. It stores such details as:

-  What type of image(s) are the input files?
-  Where are the input images located?
-  What distinguishes multiple image channels from each other? How are
   these relationships represented?
-  What information about the images and/or experiment is linked to the
   images, and how?
-  Are certain groups of images to be processed differently from other
   groups?

By using projects, the above information is stored along with the
analysis pipeline and is available on demand.

Working with projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating a project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon starting CellProfiler, you will be presented with a new, blank
project. At this point, you may start building your project by using the
modules located in the “Input modules” panel on the upper-left. The
modules are:

-  **Images**: Assemble the relevant images for analysis (required).
-  **Metadata**: Associate metadata with the images (optional).
-  **NamesAndTypes**: Assign names to channels and define their
   relationship (required).
-  **Groups**: Define sub-divisions between groups of images for
   processing (optional).

Detailed help for each module is provided by selecting the module and
clicking the “?” button on the bottom of CellProfiler.

Saving a project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you work in CellProfiler, the project is updated automatically, so
there is no need to save it unless you are saving the project to a new
name or location. You can always save your current work to a new project
file by selecting *File > Save Project As…*, which will save your
project, complete with the current image file list and pipeline, to a
file with with the extension *.cpproj*.

You also have the option of automatically saving the associated pipeline
file and the file list in addition to the project file. See *File >
Preferences…* for more details.

For those interested, some technical details:

-  The *.cpproj* file stores collected information using the HDF5
   format. Documentation on how measurements are stored and handled in
   CellProfiler using this format can be found `here`_.
-  All information is cached in the project file after it is computed.
   It is either re-computed or retrieved from the cache when an analysis
   run is started, when entering Test mode, or when the user requests a
   refreshed view of the information (e.g., when a setting has been
   changed).

Legacy modules: LoadImages and LoadData
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Historically, two modules were used for project creation: **LoadImages**
and **LoadData**. While the approach described above partly supersedes
these modules, you have the option of preserving these modules if you
load old pipelines into CellProfiler that contain them; these pipelines
will operate exactly as before.

Alternately, the user can choose to convert these modules into the
project equivalent as closely as possible. Both **LoadImages** and
**LoadData** remain accessible via the “Add module” and |image0|
buttons at the bottom of the pipeline panel.

SELECTING_IMAGES_HELP = u"""\
Any image analysis project using CellProfiler begins with providing the
program with a set of image files to be analyzed. You can do this by
clicking on the **Images** module to select it (located in the Input
modules panel on the left); this module is responsible for collecting
the names and locations of the files to be processed.

The most straightforward way to provide files to the **Images** module
is to simply drag-and-drop them from your file manager tool (e.g.,
Windows Explorer, Finder) onto the file list panel (the blank space
indicated by the text “Drop files and folders here”). Both individual
files and entire folders can be dragged onto this panel, and as many
folders and files can be placed onto this panel as needed. As you add
files, you will see a listing of the files appear in the panel.

CellProfiler supports a wide variety of image formats, including most of
those used in imaging, by using a library called Bio-Formats; see
`here`_ for the formats available. Some image formats are better than
others for image analysis. Some are `“lossy”`_ (information is lost in
the conversion to the format) like most JPG/JPEG files; others are
`lossless`_ (no image information is lost). For image analysis purposes,
a lossless format like TIF or PNG is recommended.

If you have a subset of files that you want to analyze from the full
list shown in the panel, you can also filter the files according to a
set of rules that you specify. This is useful when, for example, you
have dragged a folder of images onto the file list panel, but the folder
contains the images from one experiment that you want to process along
with images from another experiment that you want to ignore for now. You
may specify as many rules as necessary to define the desired list of
images.

performance, please see the detailed help by selecting the module and
clicking the |image0| button at the bottom of the pipeline panel, or

LOADING_IMAGE_SEQUENCES_HELP = u"""\
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this context, the term *image sequence* is used to refer to a
collection of images from a time-lapse assay (movie), a
three-dimensional (3-D) Z-stack assay, or both. This section will teach
you how to load these collections in order to properly represent your
data for processing.

Sequences of individual files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For some microscopes, the simplest method of capturing image sequences
is to simply acquire them as a series of individual image files, where
each image file represents a single timepoint and/or Z-slice. Typically,
the image filename reflects the timepoint or Z-slice, such that the
alphabetical image listing corresponds to the proper sequence, e.g.,
*img000.png*, *img001.png*, *img002.png*, etc.

It is also not uncommon to store the movie such that one movie’s worth
of files is stored in a single folder.

*Example:* You have a time-lapse movie of individual files set up as
follows:

-  Three folders, one for each image channel, named *DNA*, *actin* and
   *phase*.
-  In each folder, the files are named as follows:

   -  *DNA*: calibrate2-P01.001.TIF, calibrate2-P01.002.TIF,…,
      calibrate2-P01.287.TIF
   -  *actin*: calibrated-P01.001.TIF, calibrated-P01.002.TIF,…,
      calibrated-P01.287.TIF
   -  *phase*: phase-P01.001.TIF, phase-P01.002.TIF,…, phase-P01.287.TIF

   where the file names are in the format
   *<Stain>-<Well>.<Timepoint>.TIF*.
-  There are 287 timepoints per movie, and a movie of the 3 channels
   above is acquired from each well in a multi-well plate.

In this case, the procedure to set up the input modules to handle these
files is as follows:

-  In the **Images** module, drag-and-drop your folders of images into
   the File list panel. If necessary, set your rules accordingly in
   order to filter out any files that are not part of a movie sequence.

   In the above example, you would drag-and-drop the *DNA*, *actin* and
   *phase* folders into the File list panel.

-  In the **Metadata** module, check the box to enable metadata
   extraction. The key step here is to obtain the metadata tags
   necessary to do two things:

   -  Distinguish the movies from each other. This information is
      typically encapsulated in the filename and/or the folder name.
   -  For each movie, distinguish the timepoints from each other and
      ensure their proper ordering. This information is usually
      contained in the filename.

   To accomplish this, do the following:

   -  Select “{X_MANUAL_EXTRACTION}” or “{X_IMPORTED_EXTRACTION}” as
      the metadata extraction method. You will use these to extract the
      movie and timepoint tags from the images.
   -  Use “{X_MANUAL_EXTRACTION}” to create a regular expression to
      extract the metadata from the filename and/or path name.
   -  Or, use “{X_IMPORTED_EXTRACTION}” if you have a comma-delimited
      file (CSV) of the necessary metadata columns (including the movie
      and timepoint tags) for each image. Note that microscopes rarely
      produce such a file, but it might be worthwhile to write scripts
      to create them if you do this frequently.

   If there are multiple channels for each movie, this step may need to
   be performed for each channel.

   In this example, you could do the following:

   -  Select “{X_MANUAL_EXTRACTION}” as the method, “From file name”
      as the source, and
      ``.*-(?P<Well>[A-P][0-9]{{2}})\.(?P<Timepoint>[0-9]{{3}})`` as the
      regular expression. This step will extract the well ID and
      timepoint from each filename.
   -  Click the “Add” button to add another extraction method.
   -  In the new group of extraction settings, select
      “{X_MANUAL_EXTRACTION}” as the method, “From folder name” as the
      source, and ``.*[\\/](?P<Stain>.*)[\\/].*$`` as the regular
      expression. This step will extract the stain name from each folder
      name.
   -  Click the “Update” button below the divider and check the output
      in the table to confirm that the proper metadata values are being
      collected from each image.

-  In the **NamesAndTypes** module, assign the channel(s) to a name of
   your choice. If there are multiple channels, you will need to do this
   for each channel.

   For this example, you could do the following:

   -  Select “Assign images matching rules”.
   -  Make a new rule
      ``[Metadata][Does][Have Stain matching][actin]`` and
      name it *OrigFluor*.
   -  Click the “Add” button to define another image with a rule.
   -  Make a new rule
      ``[Metadata][Does][Have Stain matching][DNA]`` and
      name it *OrigFluo2*.
   -  Click the “Add” button to define another image with a rule.
   -  Make a new rule
      ``[Metadata][Does][Have Stain matching][phase]`` and
      name it *OrigPhase*.
   -  In the “Image set matching method” setting, select “Metadata”.
   -  Select “Well” for the *OrigFluor*, *OrigFluo2*, and *OrigPhase*
      channels.
   -  Click the |image0| button to the right to add another row, and
      select “Timepoint” for each channel.
   -  Click the “Update” button below the divider to view the resulting
      table and confirm that the proper files are listed and matched
      across the channels. The corresponding well and frame for each
      channel should now be matched to each other.

-  In the **Groups** module, enable image grouping for these images in
   order to select the metadata that defines a distinct movie of data.

   For the example above, do the following:

   -  Select “Well” as the metadata category.
   -  The tables below this setting will update themselves, and you
      should be able to visually confirm that each well is defined as a
      group, each with 287 frames’ worth of images.

   Without this step, CellProfiler would not know where one movie ends
   and the next one begins, and would process the images in all movies
   together as if they were a single movie. This would result in, for
   example, the TrackObjects module attempting to track cells from the
   end of one movie to the start of the next movie.

If your images represent a 3D image, you can follow the above example to
process your data. It is important to note, however, that CellProfiler
will analyze each Z-slice individually and sequentially. Whole volume
(3D image) processing is supported for single-channel .TIF stacks.
Splitting image channels and converting image sets into .TIF stacks can
be done using another software application, like FIJI.

Basic image sequences consisting of a single file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another common means of storing time-lapse or Z-stack data is as a
single file containing frames. Examples of this approach include image
formats such as:

-  Multi-frame TIF
-  Metamorph stack: STK
-  Evotec/PerkinElmer Opera Flex
-  Zeiss ZVI, LSM
-  Standard movie formats: AVI, Quicktime MOV, etc

CellProfiler uses the Bio-Formats library for reading various image
formats. For more details on supported files, see this `webpage`_. In
general, we recommend saving stacks and movies in .TIF format.

*Example:* You have several image stacks representing 3D structures in
the following format:

-  The stacks are saved in .TIF format.
-  Each stack is a single-channel grayscale image.
-  Your files have names like IMG01\_CH01.TIF, IMG01\_CH02.TIF, …
   IMG01\_CH04.TIF and IMG02\_CH01.TIF, IMG02\_CH02.TIF, etc, where
   IMG01\_CH01.TIF designates channel 1 from image 1, IMG01\_CH02.TIF
   designates channel 2 from image 1, and IMG02\_CH01.TIF designates
   channel 1 from image 2.

You would like to process each stack as a single image, not as a series
of 2D images. In this case, the procedure to set up the input modules to
handle these files is as follows:

-  In the **Images** module, drag-and-drop your folders of images into
   the File list panel. If necessary, set your rules accordingly in
   order to filter out any files that are not images to be processed.
   In the above example, you would drag-and-drop the .TIF files into the
   File list panel.
-  In the **NamesAndTypes** module, select “Yes” for “Data is 3D”. You
   should also provide the relative X, Y, and Z pixel sizes of your
   images. X and Y will be determined by the camera and objective you
   used to capture your images. Your Z size represents the spacing of
   your Z-series. In most cases, the X and Y pixel size will be the
   same. You can divide the Z size by X or Y to get a relative value,
   with X = Y = 1. CellProfiler will use this information to correctly
   compute filter sizes and shape features, for example.
   Additionally assign each channel to a name of your choice. You will
   need to do this for each channel. For this example, you could do the
   following:

   -  Select “Assign images matching rules”.
   -  Make a new rule ``[File][Does][Contain][CH01]``
   -  Provide a descriptive name for the channel, e.g., *DAPI*.
   -  Click the “Add another image” button to define a second image with
      a set of rules.
   -  Make a new rule ``[File][Does][Contain][CH02]``
   -  Provide a descriptive name for the channel *GFP*.
   -  Click the “Update” button below the divider to confirm that the
      proper images are listed and matched across the channels. All file
      names ending in CH01.TIF should be matched together.

*Example:* You have two image stacks in the following format:

-  The stacks are Opera’s FLEX format.
-  Each FLEX file contains 8 fields of view, with 3 channels at each
   site (DAPI, GFP, Texas Red).
-  Each channel is in grayscale format.

In this case, the procedure to set up the input modules to handle these
files is as follows:

-  In the **Images** module, drag-and-drop your folders of images into
   the File list panel. If necessary, set your rules accordingly in
   order to filter out any files that are not images to be processed.
   In the above example, you would drag-and-drop the FLEX files into the
   File list panel.
-  In the **Metadata** module, enable metadata extraction in order to
   obtain metadata from these files. The key step here is to obtain the
   necessary metadata tags to do two things:

   -  Distinguish the stacks from each other. This information is
      contained as the file itself, that is, each file represents a
      different stack.
   -  For each stack, distinguish the frames from each other. This
      information is usually contained in the image’s internal metadata,
      in contrast to the image sequence described above.

   To accomplish this, do the following:

   -  Select “{X_AUTOMATIC_EXTRACTION}” as the metadata extraction
      method. In this case, CellProfiler will extract the requisite
      information from the metadata stored in the image headers.
   -  Click the “Update metadata” button. A progress bar will appear
      showing the time elapsed; depending on the number of files
      present, this step may take a while to complete.
   -  Click the “Update” button below the divider.
   -  The resulting table should show the various metadata contained in
      the file. In this case, the relevant information is contained in
      the *C* and *Series* columns. In the figure shown, the *C* column
      shows three unique values for the channels represented, numbered
      from 0 to 2. The *Series* column shows 8 values for the slices
      collected in each stack, numbered from 0 to 7, followed by the
      slices for other stacks.

-  In the **NamesAndTypes** module, assign the channel to a name of your
   choice. If there are multiple channels, you will need to do this for
   each channel. For this example, you could do the following:

   -  Select “Assign images matching rules”.
   -  Make a new rule
      ``[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][0]``
   -  Click the |image1| button to the right of the rule to add another
      set of rules underneath.
   -  Add the rule ``[Image][Is][Stack frame]``. This combination tells
      CellProfiler not to treat the image as a single file, but rather
      as a series of frames.
   -  Name the image *DAPI*.
   -  Click the “Add another image” button to define a second image with
      a set of rules.
   -  Make a new rule
      ``[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][1]``
   -  Click the |image2| button to the right of the rule to add another
      set of rules underneath.
   -  Add the rule ``[Image][Is][Stack frame]``.
   -  Name the image *GFP*.
   -  Click the “Add another image” button to define a third image with
      a set of rules.
   -  Make a new rule
      ``[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][2]``
   -  Click the |image3| button to the right of the rule to add another
      set of rules underneath.
   -  Add the rule ``[Image][Is][Stack frame]``.
   -  Name the image *TxRed*.
   -  In the “Image set matching method” setting, select “Metadata”.
   -  Select “FileLocation” for the DAPI, GFP and TxRed channels. The
      FileLocation metadata tag identifies the individual stack, and
      selecting this parameter ensures that the channels are first
      matched within each stack, rather than across stacks.
   -  Click the |image4|  button to the right to add another row, and
      select *Series* for each channel.
   -  Click the “Update” button below the divider to confirm that the
      proper image slices are listed and matched across the channels.
      The corresponding *FileLocation* and *Series* for each channel
      should now be matched to each other.

-  In the **Groups** module, select the metadata that defines a distinct
   image stack. For the example above, do the following:

   -  Select “FileLocation” as the metadata category.
   -  The tables below this setting will update themselves, and you
      should be able to visually confirm that each of the two image
      stacks are defined as a group, each with 8 slices’ worth of
      images.

   Without this step, CellProfiler would not know where one stack ends
   and the next one begins, and would process the slices in all stacks
   together as if they were constituents of only one stack.

*Example:* You have four Z-stacks in the following format:

-  The stacks are in Zeiss’ CZI format.
-  Each stack consists of a number of slices with 4 channels (DAPI, GFP,
   Texas Red and Cy3) at each slice.
-  One stack has 9 slices, two stacks have 7 slices and the fourth has
   12 slices. Even though the stacks were collected with differing
   numbers of slices, the pipeline to be constructed is intended to
   analyze all stacks in the same manner.
-  Each slice is in grayscale format.

In this case, the procedure to set up the input modules to handle these
this file is as follows:

-  In the **Images** module, drag-and-drop your folders of images into
   the File list panel. If necessary, set your rules accordingly in
   order to filter out any files that are not images to be processed.
   In the above example, you would drag-and-drop the CZI files into the
   File list panel. In this case, the default “Images only” filter is
   sufficient to capture the necessary files.
-  In the **Metadata** module, enable metadata extraction in order to
   obtain metadata from these files. The key step here is to obtain the
   metadata tags necessary to do two things:

   -  Distinguish the stacks from each other. This information is
      contained as the file itself, that is, each file represents a
      different stack.
   -  For each stack, distinguish the z-planes from each other, ensuring
      proper ordering. This information is usually contained in the
      image file’s internal metadata.

   To accomplish this, do the following:

   -  Select “{X_AUTOMATIC_EXTRACTION}” as the metadata extraction
      method. In this case, CellProfiler will extract the requisite
      information from the metadata stored in the image headers.
   -  Click the “Update metadata” button. A progress bar will appear
      showing the time elapsed; depending on the number of files
      present, this step may take a while.
   -  Click the “Update” button below the divider.
   -  The resulting table should show the various metadata contained in
      the file. In this case, the relevant information is contained in
      the C and Z columns. The *C* column shows four unique values for
      the channels represented, numbered from 0 to 3. The *Z* column
      shows nine values for the slices represented from the first stack,
      numbered from 0 to 8.
   -  Of note in this case, for each file there is a single row
      summarizing this information. The *sizeC* column reports a value
      of 4 and *sizeZ* column shows a value of 9. You may need to scroll
      down the table to see this summary for the other stacks.

-  In the **NamesAndTypes** module, assign the channel(s) to a name of
   your choice. If there are multiple channels, you will need to do this
   for each channel.

   For the above example, you could do the following:

   -  Select “Assign images matching rules”.
   -  Make a new rule
      ``[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][0]``
   -  Click the |image5| button to the right of the rule to add another
      set of rule options.
   -  Add the rule ``[Image][Is][Stack frame]``.
   -  Name the image *DAPI*.
   -  Click the “Add another image” button to define a second image with
      a set of rules.
   -  Make a new rule
      ``[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][1]``
   -  Click the |image6| button to the right of the rule to add another
      set of rule options.
   -  Add the rule ``[Image][Is][Stack frame]``.
   -  Name the second image *GFP*.
   -  Click the “Add another image” button to define a third image with
      a set of rules.
   -  Make a new rule
      ``[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][2]``.
   -  Click the |image7| button to the right of the rule to add another
      set of rule options.
   -  Add the rule ``[Image][Is][Stack frame]``.
   -  Name the third image *TxRed*.
   -  Click the “Add another image” button to define a fourth image with
      set of rules.
   -  Make a new rule
      ``[Metadata][Does][Have C matching][3]``.
   -  Click the |image8| button to the right of the rule to add another
      set of rule options.
   -  Add the rule ``[Image][Is][Stack frame]``.
   -  Name the fourth image *Cy3*.
   -  In the “Image set matching method” setting, select “Metadata”.
   -  Select “FileLocation” for the *DAPI*,\ *GFP*,\ *TxRed*, and
      *Cy3*\ channels. The *FileLocation* identifies the individual
      stack, and selecting this parameter insures that the channels are
      matched within each stack, rather than across stacks.
   -  Click the |image9| button to the right to add another row, and
      select “Z” for each channel.
   -  Click “Update table” to confirm the channel matching. The
      corresponding *FileLocation* and *Z* for each channel should be
      matched to each other.

-  In the **Groups** module, select the metadata that defines a distinct
   image stack. For the example above, do the following:

   -  Select “FileLocation” as the metadata category.
   -  The tables below this setting will update themselves, and you
      should be able to visually confirm that each of the four image
      stacks are defined as a group, with 9, 7, 7 and 12 slices’ worth
      of images.

   Without this step, CellProfiler would not know where one stack ends
   and the next one begins, and would process the slices in all stacks
   together as if they were constituents of only one stack.

PLATEVIEWER_HELP = u"""\
The plate viewer is a data tool that displays the images in your
experiment in plate format. Your project must define an image set list
with metadata annotations for the image’s well and, optionally its plate
and site. The plate viewer will then group your images by well and
display a plate map for you. If you have defined a plate metadata tag
(with the name, “Plate”), the plate viewer will group your images by
plate and display a choice box that lets you pick the plate to display.

Click on a well to see the images for that well. If you have more than
one site per well and have site metadata (with the name, “Site”), the
plate viewer will tile the sites when displaying, and the values under
“X” and “Y” determine the position of each site in the tiled grid.

The values for “Red”, “Green”, and “Blue” in each row are brightness
multipliers- changing the values will determine the color and scaling
used to display each channel. “Alpha” determines the weight each channel
contributes to the summed image.
