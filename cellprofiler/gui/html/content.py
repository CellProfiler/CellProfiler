<p>A hallmark of most CellProfiler pipelines is the identification of cellular features in your images, whether they are
nuclei, organelles or something else. </p>

<table width="75%%" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td width="75%%" valign="top">
A number of modules are dedicated to the purpose of detecting these features; the <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> module is the
one that is most commonly used. The result of this module is a set of labeled <i>objects</i>; we define an object as a collection of connected pixels
in an image which share the same label. The challenge here is to find a combination of settings that best identify the objects from
the image, a task called <i>segmentation</i>. The typical expectation is to end up with one object for each cellular feature of interest
(for example, each nucleus is assigned to a single object in a DNA stained image). If this is not the
case, the module settings can be adjusted to make it so (or as close as possible). In some cases, image processing modules must be used beforehand
to transform the image so it is more amenable to object detection.</td>
<td width="25%%" align="center"><img src="memory:image_to_object_dataflow.png" width="254" height="225"></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In brief, the workflow of finding objects using this module is to do the following:
<ul>
<li><i>Distinguish the foreground from background:</i> The foreground is defined as that part of the image which contains
the features of interest, as opposed to the <i>background</i> which does not. The module
assumes that the foreground is brighter than the background, which is the case for fluorescence images; for other
types of images, other modules can be used to first invert the image, turning dark regions into bright regions
and vice versa. </li>
<li><i>Identify the objects in each foreground region:</i> Each foreground region may contain multiple objects
of interest (for example, touching nuclei in a DNA stained image). Recognizing the presence of these objects is the
objective of this step.</li>
<li><i>Splitting clusters of objects:</i> If objects are touching each other, the final step is to separate them in
a way that reflects the actual boundaries as much as possible. This process is referred to as "declumping."</li>
</ul>
The module also contains additional settings for filtering the results of this process on the basis of size, location, etc.
to get the final object set. At this point, the objects are ready for measurements to be made, or for further manipulations
as a means of extracting other features.</p>

<p>Other modules are able to take the results of this module and use them in combination with additional images
(like <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>) or other objects (like <b>IdentifyTertiaryObjects</b>) to define yet more objects.
</p>

<p>For more information on these identification modules work and how to configure them for best performance, please see
the detailed help by selecting the <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> module and clicking the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_HELP_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;
button at the bottom of the pipeline panel.</p>

MAKING_MEASUREMENTS_REF = urllib.quote("Making measurements")
MAKING_MEASUREMENTS_HELP = '''
<p>In most cases, the reason for identifying image features is to make measurements on them. CellProfiler has a number
of modules dedicated to calculating measurements of various types, on both images and objects; these
are accessible by clicking the <img src="memory:%(MODULE_ADD_BUTTON)s">&nbsp;button
(located underneath the pipeline panel) </p>

<p>Below is a list of measurement categories; these is not meant to be comprehensive, but are sufficient for most assays:

    <tr align="center"><td><i>Location</i></td><td> The (x,y) coordinates of each object, which can be of interest in time-lapse imaging.</td>
    <td>All modules which produce a new set of objects</td></tr>
    <tr align="center"><td><i>Morphology</i></td><td> Quantities defining the geometry of the object, as defined by its external boundary.
    This includes quantities like area, perimeter, etc.</td><td><b>MeasureImageAreaOccupied</b>,<b>MeasureObjectSizeShape</b></td></tr>
    <tr align="center"><td><i>Intensity</i></td><td> In fluorescence assays, the intensity of a pixel is related to the substance labeled with
    a fluorescence marker at that location. The maximal, minimal, mean, and integrated (total) intensity of each marker
    can be measured as well as correlations in intensity between channels.</td>
    <td><b>MeasureObjectIntensity</b>, <b>MeasureImageIntensity</b>, <b>MeasureObjectRadialDistribution</b>, <b>MeasureColocalization</b></td></tr>
    <tr align="center"><td><i>Texture</i></td><td> These quantities characterize spatial smoothness and regularity across an object, and are often useful
    for characterizing the fine patterns of localization.</td><td><b>MeasureTexture</b></td></tr>
    <tr align="center"><td><i>Clustering</i></td><td> Spatial relationships can be characterized by adjacency descriptors, such as the number of neighboring
    objects, the percent of the perimeter touching neighbor objects, etc.</td><td><b>MeasureObjectNeighbors</b></td></tr>

''' % globals()

EXPORTING_RESULTS_REF = urllib.quote("Exporting results")
EXPORTING_RESULTS_HELP = '''
<p>Writing the measurements generated by CellProfiler is necessary for downstream statistical analysis. The most
common format for export is the <i>spreadsheet</i> which is a table of values. The module <b>ExportToSpreadsheet</b>
handles the task of writing the measurements (for images, objects or both) to a file readable by Excel, or the
spreadsheet program of your choice.</p>

<p>For larger assays, involving tens of thousands of images or more, a spreadsheet is usually insufficient to handle the massive
amounts of data generated. A <i>database</i> is a better solution in this case, although this requires more sophistication
by the user; the <b>ExportToDatabase</b> module is to be used for this task. If this avenue is needed, it is best to consult
with your information technology department.</p>

<p>CellProfiler will not save images produce by analysis modules unless told to do so. It is often desirable to save
the outlines of the objects identified; this can is useful as a sanity check of the object identification results or for quality control
purposes. The <b>SaveImages</b> module is used for saving images to a variety of output formats, with the
nomenclature specified by the user.</p>
