<h2 class="title">Identifying features</h2>

    <p>A hallmark of most CellProfiler pipelines is the identification of
    cellular features in your images, whether they are nuclei, organelles or
    something else.</p>
    <table cellpadding="0" width="75%">
        <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="75%">A number of modules are dedicated to
            the purpose of detecting these features; the
            <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> module is the one that is most
            commonly used. The result of this module is a set of labeled
            <i>objects</i>; we define an object as a collection of connected
            pixels in an image which share the same label. The challenge here
            is to find a combination of settings that best identify the objects
            from the image, a task called <i>segmentation</i>. The typical
            expectation is to end up with one object for each cellular feature
            of interest (for example, each nucleus is assigned to a single
            object in a DNA stained image). If this is not the case, the module
            settings can be adjusted to make it so (or as close as possible).
            In some cases, image processing modules must be used beforehand to
            transform the image so it is more amenable to object
            detection.</td>

    </table>
    <p>In brief, the workflow of finding objects using this module is to do the
    following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Distinguish the foreground from background:</i> The foreground
        is defined as that part of the image which contains the features of
        interest, as opposed to the <i>background</i> which does not. The
        module assumes that the foreground is brighter than the background,
        which is the case for fluorescence images; for other types of images,
        other modules can be used to first invert the image, turning dark
        regions into bright regions and vice versa.</li>
        <li><i>Identify the objects in each foreground region:</i> Each
        foreground region may contain multiple objects of interest (for
        example, touching nuclei in a DNA stained image). Recognizing the
        presence of these objects is the objective of this step.</li>
        <li><i>Splitting clusters of objects:</i> If objects are touching each
        other, the final step is to separate them in a way that reflects the
        actual boundaries as much as possible. This process is referred to as
        "declumping."</li>
    </ul>The module also contains additional settings for filtering the results
    of this process on the basis of size, location, etc. to get the final
    object set. At this point, the objects are ready for measurements to be
    made, or for further manipulations as a means of extracting other features.
    <p></p>
    <p>Other modules are able to take the results of this module and use them
    in combination with additional images (like
    <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>) or other objects (like
    <b>IdentifyTertiaryObjects</b>) to define yet more objects.</p>
    <p>For more information on these identification modules work and how to
    configure them for best performance, please see the detailed help by
    selecting the <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> module and clicking the
