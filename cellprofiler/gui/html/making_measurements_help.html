<h2 class="title">Making measurements</h2>

    <p>In most cases, the reason for identifying image features is to make
    measurements on them. CellProfiler has a number of modules dedicated to
    calculating measurements of various types, on both images and objects;
    these are accessible by clicking the <img src=
    "{{MODULE_ADD_BUTTON}}">&nbsp;button (located underneath the pipeline
    panel)</p>
    <p>Below is a list of measurement categories; these is not meant to be
    comprehensive, but are sufficient for most assays:</p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="10">
        <tr align="center" bgcolor="#555555">
            <th><span style="color: #FFFFFF; "><b>Measurement</b></span></th>
            <th><span style="color: #FFFFFF; "><b>Description</b></span></th>
            <th><span style="color: #FFFFFF; "><b>Relevant modules</b></span></th>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
            <td><i>Count</i></td>
            <td>The number of objects in an image.</td>
            <td>All modules which produce a new set of objects, such as
            <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
            <td><i>Location</i></td>
            <td>The (x,y) coordinates of each object, which can be of interest
            in time-lapse imaging.</td>
            <td>All modules which produce a new set of objects</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
            <td><i>Morphology</i></td>
            <td>Quantities defining the geometry of the object, as defined by
            its external boundary. This includes quantities like area,
            perimeter, etc.</td>
            <td>
            <b>MeasureImageAreaOccupied</b>,<b>MeasureObjectSizeShape</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
            <td><i>Intensity</i></td>
            <td>In fluorescence assays, the intensity of a pixel is related to
            the substance labeled with a fluorescence marker at that location.
            The maximal, minimal, mean, and integrated (total) intensity of
            each marker can be measured as well as correlations in intensity
            between channels.</td>
            <td><b>MeasureObjectIntensity</b>, <b>MeasureImageIntensity</b>,
            <b>MeasureObjectRadialDistribution</b>,
            <b>MeasureColocalization</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
            <td><i>Texture</i></td>
            <td>These quantities characterize spatial smoothness and regularity
            across an object, and are often useful for characterizing the fine
            patterns of localization.</td>
            <td><b>MeasureTexture</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
            <td><i>Clustering</i></td>
            <td>Spatial relationships can be characterized by adjacency
            descriptors, such as the number of neighboring objects, the percent
            of the perimeter touching neighbor objects, etc.</td>
            <td><b>MeasureObjectNeighbors</b></td>
        </tr>

    performance, please see the detailed help by selecting the module and
