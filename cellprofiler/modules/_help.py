**Details on regular expressions:**

A *regular expression* is a general term refering to a method of
searching for pattern matches in text. There is a high learning curve to
using them, but are quite powerful once you understand the basics.

Patterns are specified using combinations of metacharacters and literal
characters. There are a few classes of metacharacters, partially listed
below. Some helpful links follow:

-  A more extensive explanation of regular expressions can be found
   `here`_
-  A helpful quick reference can be found
   `here <http://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/>`__
-  `Pythex`_ provides quick way to test your regular expressions. Here
   is an `example`_ to capture information from a common microscope
   nomenclature.

FILTER_RULES_BUTTONS_HELP = """\
Clicking the rule menus shows you all the file *attributes*, *operators*
and *conditions* you can specify to narrow down the image list.

#. For each rule, first select the *attribute* that the rule is to be
   based on. For example, you can select “File” to define a rule that
   will filter files on the basis of their filename.
#. The *operator* drop-down is then updated with operators applicable to
   the attribute you selected. For example, if you select “File” as the
   attribute, the operator menu includes text operators such as
   *Contain* or *Starts with*. On the other hand, if you select
   “Extension” as the attribute, you can choose the logical operators
   “Is” or “Is not” from the menu.
#. In the operator drop-down menu, select the operator you want to use.
   For example, if you want to match data exactly, you may want the
   “Exactly match” or the “Is” operator. If you want the condition to be
   more loose, select an operator such as “Contains”.
#. Use the *condition* box to type the condition you want to match. The
   more you type, the more specific the condition is.

   -  As an example, if you create a new filter and select *File* as the
      attribute, then select “Does” and “Contain” as the operators, and
      type “BBBC013” as the condition, the filter finds all files that
      include the text “BBBC013”, such as “BBBC013-1.tif” “BBBC013-2.jpg”,
      “1-BBBC013-A01.BMP” and so on.
   -  If you select “Does” and “Start with” as the operators and
      “BBBC013-1” in the Condition box, the rule will includes such files
      as “BBBC013-1.tif” “BBBC013-1-A01.png”, and so on.

.. image:: {IMAGES_USING_RULES_ICON}
   :width: 100%

You can also create regular expressions (an advanced syntax for
pattern matching) in order to select particular files.

To add another rule, click the plus buttons to the right of each rule.
Subtract an existing rule by clicking the minus button.

You can also link a set of rules by choosing the logical expression
*All* or *Any*. If you use *All* logical expression, all the rules must
be true for a file to be included in the File list. If you use the *Any*
option, only one of the conditions has to be met for a file to be
included.

If you want to create more complex rules (e.g, some criteria matching
all rules and others matching any), you can create sets of rules, by
clicking the ellipsis button (to the right of the plus button). Repeat
the above steps to add more rules to the filter until you have all the
conditions you want to include.

To measure distances in an open image, use the “Measure length” tool

HELP_ON_MEASURING_INTENSITIES = """\
Note that for publication purposes, the units of intensity from
microscopy images are usually described as “Intensity units” or
“Arbitrary intensity units” because microscopes are not calibrated to an
absolute scale. Also, it is important to note whether you are reporting
the mean vs. the integrated intensity, so specify “Mean intensity
units” or “Integrated intensity units” accordingly.

Keep in mind that the default behavior in CellProfiler is to rescale the
image intensity from 0 to 1 by dividing all pixels in the image by the
maximum possible intensity value. This “maximum possible” value is
defined by the “Set intensity range from” setting in **NamesAndTypes**;
see the help for that setting for more details.

IO_FOLDER_CHOICE_HELP_TEXT = """\
You can choose among the following options which are common to all file
input/output modules:

-  *Default Input Folder*: Use the default input folder.
-  *Default Output Folder:* Use the default output folder.
-  *Elsewhere…*: Use a particular folder you specify.
-  *Default input directory sub-folder*: Enter the name of a subfolder
   of the default input folder or a path that starts from the default
   input folder.
-  *Default output directory sub-folder*: Enter the name of a subfolder
   of the default output folder or a path that starts from the default
   output folder.

*Elsewhere* and the two sub-folder options all require you to enter an
additional path name. You can use an *absolute path* (such as
“C:\\\\imagedir\\\\image.tif” on a PC) or a *relative path* to specify
the file location relative to a directory, which makes the pipeline
more flexible for future runs):

-  Use one period to represent the current directory. For example, if
   you choose *Default Input Folder sub-folder*, you can enter
   “./MyFiles” to look in a folder called “MyFiles” that is contained
   within the Default Input Folder.
-  Use two periods “..” to move up one folder level. For example, if you
   choose *Default Input Folder sub-folder*, you can enter “../MyFolder”
   to look in a folder called “MyFolder” at the same level as the
   Default Input Folder.\

For *{ABSOLUTE_FOLDER_NAME}*, *{DEFAULT_INPUT_SUBFOLDER_NAME}* and
*{DEFAULT_OUTPUT_SUBFOLDER_NAME}*, if you have metadata associated
with your images via **Metadata** module, you can name the folder using any
metadata tags for which all images in each individual image set have the same value.

-  Example: if you had extracted "*Plate*", "*Well*", and "*Channel*" metadata
   from your images, for most pipelines folders based on "*Plate*" or "*Well*" would work since
   each individual image set would come only from a single well on a single plate, but
   folders based on "*Channel*" would not work as each individual image set might
   contain many channels.

{USING_METADATA_TAGS_REF}

For instance, if you have a metadata tag named “Plate”, you can create a
per-plate folder by selecting one of the subfolder options and then
specifying the subfolder name as “\\g<Plate>”. The module will
substitute the metadata values for the current image set for any
metadata tags in the folder name.
