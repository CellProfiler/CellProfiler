characters. There are a few classes of metacharacters, partially listed

   `here <http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet/>`__

FILTER_RULES_BUTTONS_HELP = """\
Clicking the rule menus shows you all the file *attributes*, *operators*
and *conditions* you can specify to narrow down the image list.

#. For each rule, first select the *attribute* that the rule is to be
   based on. For example, you can select “File” to define a rule that
   will filter files on the basis of their filename.
#. The *operator* drop-down is then updated with operators applicable to
   the attribute you selected. For example, if you select “File” as the
   attribute, the operator menu includes text operators such as
   *Contain* or *Starts with*. On the other hand, if you select
   “Extension” as the attribute, you can choose the logical operators
   “Is” or “Is not” from the menu.
#. In the operator drop-down menu, select the operator you want to use.
   For example, if you want to match data exactly, you may want the
   “Exactly match” or the “Is” operator. If you want the condition to be
   more loose, select an operator such as “Contains”.
#. Use the *condition* box to type the condition you want to match. The
   more you type, the more specific the condition is.

   -  As an example, if you create a new filter and select *File* as the
      attribute, then select “Does” and “Contain” as the operators, and
      type “Channel” as the condition, the filter finds all files that
      include the text “Channel”, such as “Channel1.tif” “Channel2.jpg”,
      “1-Channel-A01.BMP” and so on.
   -  If you select “Does” and “Start with” as the operators and
      “Channel1” in the Condition box, the rule will includes such files
      as “Channel1.tif” “Channel1-A01.png”, and so on.

   +------------+
   | |image0|   |
   +------------+

   You can also create regular expressions (an advanced syntax for
   pattern matching) in order to select particular files.

To add another rule, click the plus buttons to the right of each rule.
Subtract an existing rule by clicking the minus button.

You can also link a set of rules by choosing the logical expression
*All* or *Any*. If you use *All* logical expression, all the rules must
be true for a file to be included in the File list. If you use the *Any*
option, only one of the conditions has to be met for a file to be
included.

If you want to create more complex rules (e.g, some criteria matching
all rules and others matching any), you can create sets of rules, by
clicking the ellipsis button (to the right of the plus button). Repeat
the above steps to add more rules to the filter until you have all the
conditions you want to include.

Details on regular expressions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

A *regular expression* is a general term refering to a method of
searching for pattern matches in text. There is a high learning curve to
using them, but are quite powerful once you understand the basics.

“C:\\imagedir\\image.tif” on a PC) or a *relative path* to specify the
file location relative to a directory):

   you choose *Default Input Folder sub-folder*, you can enter
   “./MyFiles” to look in a folder called “MyFiles” that is contained
   within the Default Input Folder.
