'''<b>Align</b> aligns images relative to each other, for example, to correct 
shifts in the optical path of a microscope in each channel of a multi-channel 
set of images
<hr>

For two or more input images, this module determines the optimal alignment 
among them. Aligning images is useful to obtain proper measurements of the 
intensities in one channel based on objects identified in another channel, 
for example. Alignment is often needed when the microscope is not perfectly 
calibrated. It can also be useful to align images in a time-lapse series of 
images.  The module stores the amount of shift between images as a
measurement, which can be useful for quality control purposes.

<h4>Available measurements</h4>
<ul> 
<li><i>XShift, Yshift:</i> The pixel shift in X and Y of the N<sup>th</sup> 
aligned image with respect to the first image.</li>
</ul>

             <ul>
             <li><i>Normalized Cross Correlation:</i> This is a good means 
             of alignment in the case of images acquired with the same modality
             (e.g., all images to be aligned are fluorescent). It allows for a
             linear relationship between the intensities of the two images, 
             e.g., the relevant features in the images to be aligned all have
             varying degrees of brightness.  When using the cross correlation method, 
             the second image should serve as a template and be smaller than the first 
             image selected. </li>
             <li><i>Mutual Information:</i> This more general method works well for aligning
             images from different modalities that contain the same information, but are 
             expressed differently. Essentially, alignment is performed by measuring
             how well one image "explains" the other. For example, a flourescent image 
             can be aligned to a brightfield image by this method since the relevant 
             features are bright in one modality where they are dim in the other. </li>
