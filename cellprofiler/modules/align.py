Align
=====

**Align** aligns images relative to each other, for example, to correct
shifts in the optical path of a microscope in each channel of a
multi-channel set of images.

For two or more input images, this module determines the optimal
alignment among them. Aligning images is useful to obtain proper
measurements of the intensities in one channel based on objects
identified in another channel, for example. Alignment is often needed
when the microscope is not perfectly calibrated. It can also be useful
to align images in a time-lapse series of images. The module stores the
amount of shift between images as a measurement, which can be useful for
quality control purposes.

Note that the second image (and others following) is always aligned with
respect to the first image. That is, the X/Y offsets indicate how much
the second image needs to be shifted by to match the first.

This module does not perform warping or rotation, it simply shifts images
in X and Y. For more complex registration tasks, you might preprocess
images using a plugin for that purpose in FIJI/ImageJ.

Two options for the alignment method are available:

-  *%(M_MUTUAL_INFORMATION)s:* This more general method works well for
   aligning images from different modalities that contain the same
   information, but are expressed differently. However, this method
   performs better than %(M_CROSS_CORRELATION)s, even in the same
   modality, if the images are not highly correlated. It is iterative,
   and thus tends to be slower than other methods, but is more likely to
   be correct. Essentially, alignment is performed by measuring how well
   one image “explains” the other. For example, a fluorescent image can
   be aligned to a brightfield image by this method since the relevant
   features are bright in one modality where they are dim in the other.
-  *%(M_CROSS_CORRELATION)s:* This is a good means of alignment in the
   case of images acquired with the same modality (e.g., all images to
   be aligned are fluorescent). It is fast, however it can be highly
   influenced by a particular, possibly spurious, feature and in turn
   generate anomalously large shifts. It allows for a linear
   relationship between the intensities of the two images, i.e., the
   relevant features in the images to be aligned all have varying
   degrees of brightness.

        self.crop_mode = cps.Choice(
                "Crop mode", [C_CROP, C_PAD, C_SAME_SIZE], doc="""\
The crop mode determines how the output images are either cropped or
padded after alignment. The alignment phase calculates the areas in each
image that are found to be overlapping. In almost all cases, there will
be portions of some or all of the images that don’t overlap with any
other aligned image. These portions have no counterpart and will be
excluded from analysis. There are three choices for cropping:

-  *%(C_CROP)s:* Crop every image to the region that overlaps in all
   images. This makes downstream analysis simpler because all of the
   output images have authentic pixel data at all positions, however it
   discards parts of images. Also, the output images may not be the same
   size as the input images which may cause problems if downstream
   modules use aligned and unaligned images (which may be of differing
   sizes) in combination.
-  *%(C_PAD)s:* Align every image and pad with masked black pixels to
   make each image the same size. This results in larger images, but
   preserves all information in each of the images. This may be the best
   choice if images undergo an operation such as smoothing that could
   use the information that would otherwise be cropped.
-  *%(C_SAME_SIZE)s:* Maintain the sizes of the images but align them,
   masking the unaligned portions with black pixels. **Align** aligns
   all images relative to the first. This is a reasonable option for
   alignments with small displacements since it maintains a consistent
   image size which may be useful if output images from different image
   sets will be compared against each other after processing. The
   reference image can also be used across image sets. For example, the
   reference image could be loaded for all image sets in a group to
   align the entire group’s images similarly, then the aligned images
   could be combined in a module such as **MakeProjection**.
