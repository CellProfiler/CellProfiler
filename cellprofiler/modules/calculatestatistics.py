CalculateStatistics
===================

**CalculateStatistics** calculates measures of assay quality (V and Z’
factors) and dose-response data (EC50) for all measured features made
from images.

The V and Z’ factors are statistical measures of assay quality and are
calculated for each per-image measurement and for each average
per-object measurement that you have made in the pipeline. Placing this
module at the end of a pipeline in order to calculate these values
allows you to identify which measured features are most powerful for
distinguishing positive and negative control samples (Z' factor), or for accurately
quantifying the assay’s response to dose (V factor). These measurements will be
calculated for all measured values (Intensity, AreaShape, Texture,
etc.) upstream in the pipeline. The statistics calculated by this module
can be exported as the “Experiment” set of data.

What do I need as input?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Example format for a file to be loaded by **LoadData** for this module:

**LoadData** loads information from a CSV file. The first line of this
file is a header that names the items. Each subsequent line represents
data for one image cycle, so your file should have the header line
plus one line per image to be processed. You can also make a file for
**LoadData** to load that contains the positive/negative control and
dose designations *plus* the image file names to be processed, which
is a good way to guarantee that images are matched with the correct
data. The control and dose information can be designated in one of two
ways:

.. _(link): http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/108705719900400206
.. _Ilya Ravkin: http://www.ravkin.net

-  As metadata (so that the column header is prefixed with the
   “Metadata\_” tag). “Metadata” is the category and the name after the
   underscore is the measurement.
-  As some other type of data, in which case the header needs to be of
   the form *<prefix>\_<measurement>*. Select *<prefix>* as the category
   and *<measurement>* as the measurement.

Here is an example file:

| Image\_FileName\_CY3,   | Image\_PathName\_CY3,   | Data\_Control,   | Data\_Dose   |

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Experiment features:** Whereas most CellProfiler measurements are
   calculated for each object (per-object) or for each image
   (per-image), this module produces *per-experiment* values; for
   example, one Z’ factor is calculated for each measurement, across the
   entire analysis run.

   -  *Zfactor:* The Z’-factor indicates how well separated the positive
      and negative controls are. A Z’-factor > 0 is potentially
      screenable; a Z’-factor > 0.5 is considered an excellent assay.
      The formula is 1 - 3 × (σ\ :sub:`p` +
      σ\ :sub:`n`)/\|μ\ :sub:`p` - μ\ :sub:`n`\ \| where σ\ :sub:`p` and
      σ\ :sub:`n` are the standard deviations of the positive and
      negative controls, and μ\ :sub:`p` and μ\ :sub:`n` are the means
      of the positive and negative controls.
   -  *Vfactor:* The V-factor is a generalization of the Z’-factor, and
      is calculated as 1 - 6 × mean(σ)/\|μ\ :sub:`p` -
      μ\ :sub:`n`\ \| where σ are the standard deviations of the data,
      and μ\ :sub:`p` and μ\ :sub:`n` are defined as above.
   -  *EC50:* The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) is the
      concentration of a treatment required to induce a response that
      is 50% of the maximal response.
   -  *OneTailedZfactor:* This measure is an attempt to overcome a
      limitation of the original Z’-factor formulation (it assumes a
      Gaussian distribution) and is informative for populations with
      moderate or high amounts of skewness. In these cases, long tails
      opposite to the mid-range point lead to a high standard deviation
      for either population, which results in a low Z’ factor even
      though the population means and samples between the means may be
      well-separated. Therefore, the one-tailed Z’ factor is calculated
      with the same formula but using only those samples that lie
      between the positive/negative population means. **This is not yet
      a well established measure of assay robustness, and should be
      considered experimental.**

For both Z’ and V factors, the highest possible value (best assay
quality) is 1, and they can range into negative values (for assays where
distinguishing between positive and negative controls is difficult or
impossible). The Z’ factor is based only on positive and negative
controls. The V factor is based on an entire dose-response curve rather
than on the minimum and maximum responses. When there are only two doses
in the assay (positive and negative controls only), the V factor will
equal the Z’ factor.

Note that if the standard deviation of a measured feature is zero for a
particular set of samples (e.g., all the positive controls), the Z’ and
V factors will equal 1 despite the fact that the assay quality is poor.
This can occur when there is only one sample at each dose. This also
occurs for some non-informative measured features, like the number of
cytoplasm compartments per cell, which is always equal to 1.

This module can create MATLAB scripts that display the EC50 curves for
each measurement. These scripts will require MATLAB and the statistics
toolbox in order to run. See *Create dose-response plots?* below.

The Z’ factor, a measure of assay quality, is calculated by this module
based on measurements from images that are specified as positive
controls and images that are specified as negative controls. Images
that are neither are ignored. The module assumes that all of the
negative controls are specified by a minimum value, all of the positive
controls are specified by a maximum value, and all other images have an
intermediate value; this might allow you to use your dosing information
to also specify the positive and negative controls. If you don’t use
actual dose data to designate your controls, a common practice is to
designate -1 as a negative control, 0 as an experimental sample, and 1
as a positive control. In other words, positive controls should all be
specified by a single high value (for instance, 1) and negative controls
should all be specified by a single low value (for instance, -1). Other
samples should have an intermediate value to exclude them from the Z’
factor analysis.

The typical way to provide this information in the pipeline is to create
a text comma-delimited (CSV) file outside of CellProfiler and then load
that file into the pipeline using the **Metadata** module or the legacy
**LoadData** module. In that case, choose the measurement that matches
the column header of the measurement in the input file. See the main
module help for this module or for the **Metadata** module for an
example text file.
