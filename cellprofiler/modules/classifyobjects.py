ClassifyObjects
===============

**ClassifyObjects** classifies objects into different classes according
to the value of measurements you choose.

This module classifies objects into a number of different bins according
to the value of a measurement (e.g., by size, intensity, shape). It
reports how many objects fall into each class as well as the percentage
of objects that fall into each class. The module asks you to select the
measurement feature to be used to classify your objects and specify the
bins to use. It also requires you to have run a measurement or
**CalculateMath** previous to this module in the pipeline so that the
measurement values can be used to classify the objects.

There are two flavors of classification:

-  The first classifies each object according to the measurements you
   choose and assigns each object to one class per measurement. You may
   specify more than two classification bins per measurement.
-  The second classifies each object according to two measurements and
   two threshold values. The module classifies each object once per
   measurement resulting in four possible object classes. The module
   then stores one measurement per object, based on the object’s class.

Note that objects without a measurement are not counted as belonging in
a classification bin and will not show up in the output image (shown in
the module display window); in the object classification they will have
a value of False for all bins. However, they are still counted in the
total number of objects and hence are reflected in the classification
percentages.

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Image measurements:**

   -  *NumObjectsPerBin:* The number of objects that are classified into
      each bin.
   -  *PctObjectsPerBin:* The percentage of total objects that are
      classified into each bin.

-  **Object measurements:**

   -  Single measurement: Classification (true/false) of the
      N\ :sup:`th` bin for the M\ :sup:`th` measurement.
   -  Two measurement: Classification (true/false) of the 1\ :sup:`st`
      measurement versus the 2\ :sup:`nd` measurement binned into bins
      above (“high”) and below (“low”) the cutoff.
