ConvertImageToObjects
=====================

**ConvertImageToObjects** converts a binary image to objects. Connected components of the binary image are assigned to
the same object. This module is useful for identifying objects that can be cleanly distinguished using **Threshold**.
If you wish to distinguish clumped objects, see **Watershed** or the **Identify** modules.

Note that grayscale images provided as input to this module will be converted to binary images. Pixel intensities
below or equal to 50% of the input's full intensity range are assigned to the background (i.e., assigned the value 0).
Pixel intensities above 50% of the input's full intensity range are assigned to the foreground (i.e., assigned the
value 1).
