'''<b>Correct Illumination - Calculate</b> calculates an illumination function that is used to correct uneven
illumination/lighting/shading or to reduce uneven background in images.
<hr>
This module calculates an illumination function that can either be saved to the
hard drive for later use or immediately applied to images later in the
pipeline. This function will correct for the uneven illumination in images.
If saving, select <i>.mat</i> format in <b>SaveImages</b>.
Use the <b>CorrectIlluminationApply</b> module to apply the
function to the image to be corrected.

Illumination correction is a challenge to do properly; please see the
<a href="http://www.cellprofiler.org/examples.html">examples</a> and
<a href="http://cellprofiler.org/tutorials.html">tutorials</a> pages
on the CellProfiler website for further advice.

             cover most of the image, the <i>Regular</i> method might be appropriate. Regular
             intensities makes the illumination function based on the intensity at
             each pixel of the image (or group of images if you are in <i>%(EA_ALL)s</i> mode) and
             is most often rescaled (see below) and applied by division using
             <b>CorrectIlluminationApply.</b> Note that if you are in <i>%(EA_EACH)s</i> mode or using a
             small set of images with few objects, there will be regions in the
             average image that contain no objects and smoothing by median filtering
             is unlikely to work well.
             <i>Note:</i> it does not make sense to choose (<i>%(IC_REGULAR)s + %(SM_NONE)s + %(EA_EACH)s</i>)
             because the illumination function would be identical to the original
             image and applying it will yield a blank image. You either need to smooth
             each image, or you need to use <i>%(EA_ALL)s</i> images.</li>
             <li><i>%(IC_BACKGROUND)s:</i>
             If you think that the background (dim points) between objects show the
             same pattern of illumination as your objects of interest, you can choose the
             <i>%(IC_BACKGROUND)s</i> method. Background intensities finds the minimum pixel
             intensities in blocks across the image (or group of images if you are in
             <i>%(EA_ALL)s</i> mode) and is most often applied by subtraction using the

             <i>Note:</i> if you will be using the <i>%(DOS_SUBTRACT)s</i> option in the

             rescale the illumination function. </li>

             <p>Please note that if a mask was applied to the input image, the pixels outside of the
             mask will be excluded from consideration. This is useful, for instance, in cases where
             you have masked out the well edge in an image from a multi-well plate; the dark well
             edge would distort the illumination correction function along the interior well edge.

            image or you can calculate the illumination function using all of
            the images in each group.
            The illumination function can be calculated in one of the three ways:

            <b>CorrectIllumination_Apply</b> module in the same pipeline, but also
            means that you will not have the ability to filter out images (e.g., by using

            You can use <b>SaveImages</b> to save the illumination function

             this is almost certainly necessary. If you have few objects in each image or a
             small image set, you may want to smooth.
             <p>You should smooth to the point where the illumination function resembles a believable pattern.
             For example, if you are trying to correct a lamp illumination problem,
             apply smoothing until you obtain a fairly smooth pattern
             without sharp bright or dim regions.  Note that smoothing is a
             time-consuming process, but some methods are faster than others.
             <ul>
             <li><i>%(SM_FIT_POLYNOMIAL)s:</i> This methdod is fastest but does not
             allow a very tight fit compared to the slower median and Gaussian
             filtering methods. </li>
             <li>%(SM_MEDIAN_FILTER)s, <i>%(SM_GAUSSIAN_FILTER)s:</i> Use a
             median or Gaussian filter, respectively. We typically recommend <i>%(SM_MEDIAN_FILTER)s</i>
             vs. <i>%(SM_GAUSSIAN_FILTER)s</i> because the median
             is less sensitive to outliers, although the results are also slightly
             less smooth and the fact that images are in the range of 0 to 1 means that
             outliers typically will not dominate too strongly anyway.</li>
             <li><i>%(SM_TO_AVERAGE)s:</i> A less commonly
             used option is to completely smooth the entire image, which will create a flat,
             smooth image where every pixel of the image is the average of what the illumination
             function would otherwise have been.</li>
             <li><i>%(SM_SPLINES)s:</i> This method (<i>Lindblad and Bengtsson, 2001</i>)
             fits a grid of cubic splines to the background while
             excluding foreground pixels from the calculation. It operates
             iteratively, classifying pixels as background, computing a best
             fit spline to this background and then reclassifying pixels
             as background until the spline converges on its final value.</li>
             <li><i>%(SM_CONVEX_HULL)s:</i> This method algorithm proceeds as follows:
             <ul><li>Choose 256 evenly-spaced intensity levels between the
             minimum and maximum intensity for the image</li>
             <li>Set the intensity of the output image to the minimum intensity
             of the input image</li>
             <li>Iterate over the intensity levels, from lowest to highest
             <ul>
             <li>For a given intensity, find all pixels with
             equal or higher intensities</li>
             <li>Find the convex hull that encloses those pixels</li>
             <li>Set the intensity of the output image within the convex hull
             to the current intensity</li>
             </ul></li>
             </ul>
             The Convex Hull method can be used on an image whose objects
             are darker than their background and whose illumination
             intensity decreases monotonically from the brightest point.</li>

            deviation for the current iteration and the previous iteration
            is less than the convergence criterion.
