DisplayDensityPlot
==================

**DisplayDensityPlot** plots measurements as a two-dimensional density
plot.

A density plot displays the relationship between two measurements (that
is, features) but instead of showing each data point as a dot, as in a
scatter plot, the data points are binned into an equally-spaced grid of
points, where the color of each point in the grid represents the
tabulated frequency of the measurements within that region of the grid.
A density plot is also known as a 2-D histogram; in a conventional
histogram the height of a bar indicates how many data points fall in
that region. By contrast, in a density plot (2-D histogram), the color
of a portion of the plot indicates the number of data points in that
region.

The module shows the values generated for the current cycle. However,
this module can also be run as a Data Tool, in which case you will first
be asked for the output file produced by the analysis run. The
resulting plot is created from all the measurements collected during
the run.

At this time, the display produced when **DisplayDensityPlot** is run as a
module cannot be saved in the pipeline (e.g., by using **SaveImages**). The
display can be saved manually by selecting the window produced by the
module and clicking the Save icon in its menu bar or by choosing *File
> Save* from CellProfiler's main menu bar.
