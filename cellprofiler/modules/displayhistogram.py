DisplayHistogram
================

**DisplayHistogram** plots a histogram of the desired measurement.

A histogram is a bar plot depicting frequencies of items in each data range.
Here, each bar's value is created by binning measurement data for a set of
objects. A two-dimensional histogram can be created using the
**DisplayDensityPlot** module.

The module shows the values generated for the current cycle. However,
this module can also be run as a Data Tool, in which you will first be
asked for the output file produced by the analysis run. The resultant
plot is created from all the measurements collected during the run.

At this time, the display produced when **DisplayHistogram** is run as a
module cannot be saved in the pipeline (e.g., by using **SaveImages**). The
display can be saved manually by selecting the window produced by the
module and clicking the Save icon in its menu bar or by choosing *File
> Save* from CellProfiler's main menu bar.
