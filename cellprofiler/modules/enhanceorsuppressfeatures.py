'''<b>Enhance Or Suppress Features</b> enhances or suppresses certain image features 
(such as speckles, ring shapes, and neurites), which can improve subsequent
identification of objects.
<hr>
This module enhances or suppresses the intensity of certain pixels relative
to the rest of the image, by applying image processing filters to the image. It
produces a grayscale image in which objects can be identified using an <b>Identify</b> module.

            <i>(Used only if %(ENHANCE)s is selected)</i><br>
            This module can enhance three kinds of image intensity features:
            <ul>
            <li><i>%(E_SPECKLES)s:</i> A speckle is an area of enhanced intensity
            relative to its immediate neighborhood. The module enhances
            speckles using a white tophat filter, which is the image minus the
            morphological grayscale opening of the image. The opening operation
            first suppresses the speckles by applying a grayscale erosion to reduce everything
            within a given radius to the lowest value within that radius, then uses
            a grayscale dilation to restore objects larger than the radius to an
            approximation of their former shape. The white tophat filter enhances
            speckles by subtracting the effects of opening from the original image.
            </li>
            <li><i>%(E_NEURITES)s:</i> Neurites are taken to be long, thin features
            of enhanced intensity. Choose this option to enhance the intensity
            of the neurites using the %(N_GRADIENT)s or %(N_TUBENESS)s methods
            described below.</li>
            <li><i>%(E_DARK_HOLES)s:</i> The module uses morphological reconstruction
            (the rolling-ball algorithm) to identify dark holes within brighter
            areas, or brighter ring shapes. The image is inverted so that the dark holes turn into
            bright peaks. The image is successively eroded and the eroded image
            is reconstructed at each step, resulting in an image which is
            missing the peaks. Finally, the reconstructed image is subtracted
            from the previous reconstructed image. This leaves circular bright
            spots with a radius equal to the number of iterations performed.
            </li>
            <li><i>%(E_CIRCLES)s:</i> The module calculates the circular Hough transform of
            the image at the diameter given by the feature size. The Hough transform
            will have the highest intensity at points that are centered within a ring
            of high intensity pixels where the ring diameter is the feature size. You
            may want to use the <b>EnhanceEdges</b> module to find the edges of your
            circular object and then process the output by enhancing circles. You can
            use <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> to find the circle centers and then use
            these centers as seeds in <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b> to find whole,
            circular objects using a watershed.</li>
            <li><i>%(E_TEXTURE)s:</i> <b>EnanceOrSuppressFeatures</b> produces an image
            whose intensity is the variance among nearby pixels. This method weights
            pixel contributions by distance using a Gaussian to calculate the weighting.
            You can use this method to separate foreground from background if the foreground
            is textured and the background is not.
            </li>
            <li><i>%(E_DIC)s:</i> This method recovers the optical density of a DIC image by
            integrating in a direction perpendicular to the shear direction of the image.
            </li>
            </ul>

                         for the module as stored in the pipeline
        variable_revision_number - the variable revision number of the
                         module at the time the pipeline was saved. Use this
                         to determine how the incoming setting values map
                         to those of the current module version.
        module_name - the name of the module that did the saving. This can be
                      used to import the settings from another module if
                      that module was merged into the current module
        from_matlab - True if the settings came from a Matlab pipeline, False
                      if the settings are from a CellProfiler 2.0 pipeline.

        Overriding modules should return a tuple of setting_values,
        variable_revision_number and True if upgraded to CP 2.0, otherwise
        they should leave things as-is so that the caller can report
        an error.
