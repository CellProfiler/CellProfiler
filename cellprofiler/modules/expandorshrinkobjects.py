'''<b>Expand Or Shrink Objects</b> expands or shrinks objects by a defined distance
<hr>

The module expands or shrinks objects by adding or removing border
pixels. You can specify a certain number of border pixels to be
added or removed, expand objects until they are almost touching or shrink
objects down to a point. Objects are never lost using this module (shrinking 
stops when an object becomes a single pixel). The module can separate touching
objects without otherwise shrinking
the objects.

<p><b>ExpandOrShrinkObjects</b> can perform some specialized morphological operations that 
remove pixels without completely removing an object. See the Settings help (below)
for more detail.</p>

<p><i>Special note on saving images:</i> You can use the settings in this module to pass object
outlines along to the module <b>OverlayOutlines</b> and then save them 
with the <b>SaveImages</b> module. You can also pass the identified objects themselves along to the
object processing module <b>ConvertToImage</b> and then save them with the
<b>SaveImages</b> module.</p>

<h4>Available measurements</h4>
<i>Image features:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Count:</i> Number of expanded/shrunken objects in the image.</li>
</ul>
<i>Object features:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Location_X, Location_Y:</i> Pixel (<i>X,Y</i>) coordinates of the center of mass of 
the expanded/shrunken objects.</li>
</ul>
