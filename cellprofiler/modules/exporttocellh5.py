'''<b>ExportToCellH5</b> exports measurements, objects and object relationships,
and images to the CellH5 data format.
<hr>
<h4>File structure</h4>
In multiprocessing-mode, CellProfiler will create satellite .cellh5 files that
are linked to the one that you specify using this module. The only thing
to note is that you must keep all .cellh5 files that are generated together
if you move them to a new folder.

    # TODO: model z and t. Currently, CellProfiler would analyze each
    #       stack plane independently. I think the easiest way to handle
    #       z and t would be to add them to the site path if they are
    #       used in the experiment (e.g. a time series would have a
    #       path of "/plate/well/site/time")
    #
    #       I can add two more optional metadata keys that would let
    #       users capture this.
    #
    #       The more-complicated choice would be to store the data in a
    #       stack which would mean reworking the indices in every segmentation
    #       after the first. There are some legacy measurements that are
    #       really object numbers, so these would require a lot of work
    #       to get right. Also, the resulting segmentations are a little
    #       artificial since they seem to say that every object is one
    #       pixel thick in the T or Z direction.
