            The thresholding strategy determines the type of input that is used
            to calculate the threshold. The image thresholds can be based on:
            <ul>
            <li>The pixel intensities of the input image (this is the most common).</li>
            <li>A single value manually provided by the user.</li>
            <li>A single value produced by a prior module measurement.</li>
            <li>A binary image (called a <i>mask</i>) where some of the pixel intensity
            values are set to 0, and others are set to 1.</li>
            </ul>
            These options allow you to calculate a threshold based on the whole
            image or based on image sub-regions such as user-defined masks or
            objects supplied by a prior module.
            <br>
            The choices for the threshold strategy are:
            <br><ul>
            <li><i>%(TS_AUTOMATIC)s:</i> Use the default settings for
            thresholding. This strategy calculates the threshold using the %(TM_MCT)s method
            on the whole image (see below for details on this method) and applies the
            threshold to the image, smoothed with a Gaussian with sigma of 1.
            <dl>
            <dd><img src="memory:%(PROTIP_RECOMEND_ICON)s">&nbsp;
            This approach is fairly robust, but does not allow you to select the threshold
            algorithm and does not allow you to apply additional corrections to the
            threshold.</dd>
            </dl></li>

            <li><i>%(TS_GLOBAL)s:</i> Calculate a single threshold value based on
            the unmasked pixels of the input image and use that value
            to classify pixels above the threshold as foreground and below
            as background.

            <dd><img src="memory:%(PROTIP_RECOMEND_ICON)s">&nbsp;
            This strategy is fast and robust, especially if
            the background is uniformly illuminated.</dd>
            </dl></li>

            <li><i>%(TS_ADAPTIVE)s:</i> Partition the input image into tiles
            and calculate thresholds for each tile. For each tile, the calculated
            threshold is applied only to the pixels within that tile. <br>
            <dl>
            <dd><img src="memory:%(PROTIP_RECOMEND_ICON)s">&nbsp;
            This method is slower but can produce better results for non-uniform backgrounds.
            However, for signifcant illumination variation, using the <b>CorrectIllumination</b>
            modules is preferable.</dd>
            </dl></li>

            <li><i>%(TS_PER_OBJECT)s:</i> Use objects from a prior module
            such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> to define the region of interest
            to be thresholded. Calculate a separate threshold for each object and
            then apply that threshold to pixels within the object. The pixels outside
            the objects are classified as background.
            <dl>
            <dd><img src="memory:%(PROTIP_RECOMEND_ICON)s">&nbsp;
            This method can be useful for identifying sub-cellular particles or
            single-molecule probes if the background intensity varies from cell to cell
            (e.g., autofluorescence or other mechanisms).</dd>
            </dl></li>

            <li><i>%(TS_MANUAL)s:</i> Enter a single value between zero and
            one that applies to all cycles and is independent of the input
            image.

            <dd><img src="memory:%(PROTIP_RECOMEND_ICON)s">&nbsp;
            This approach is useful if the input image has a stable or
            negligible background, or if the input image is the probability
            map output of the <b>ClassifyPixels</b> module (in which case, a value
            of 0.5 should be chosen). If the input image is already binary (i.e.,
            where the foreground is 1 and the background is 0), a manual value
            of 0.5 will identify the objects.</dd>
            </dl></li>

            <li><i>%(TS_BINARY_IMAGE)s:</i> Use a binary image to classify
            pixels as foreground or background. Pixel values other than zero
            will be foreground and pixel values that are zero will be
            background. This method can be used to import a ground-truth segmentation created
            by CellProfiler or another program.
            <dl>
            <dd><img src="memory:%(PROTIP_RECOMEND_ICON)s">&nbsp;
            The most typical approach to produce a
            binary image is to use the <b>ApplyThreshold</b> module (image as input,
            image as output) or the <b>ConvertObjectsToImage</b> module (objects as input,
            image as output); both have options to produce a binary image. It can also be
            used to create objects from an image mask produced by other CellProfiler
            modules, such as <b>Morph</b>. Note that even though no algorithm is actually
            used to find the threshold in this case, the final threshold value is reported
            as the <i>%(TM_OTSU)s</i> threshold calculated for the foreground region.</dd>
            </dl></li>

            <li><i>%(TS_MEASUREMENT)s:</i> Use a prior image measurement as the
            threshold. The measurement should have values between zero and one.
            This strategy can be used to apply a pre-calculated threshold imported
            as per-image metadata via the <b>Metadata</b> module.
            <dl>
            <dd><img src="memory:%(PROTIP_RECOMEND_ICON)s">&nbsp;
            Like manual thresholding, this approach can be useful when you are certain what
            the cutoff should be. The difference in this case is that the desired threshold does
            vary from image to image in the experiment but can be measured using another module,
            such as one of the <b>Measure</b> modules, <b>ApplyThreshold</b> or
            an <b>Identify</b> module.</dd>

            The intensity threshold affects the decision of whether each pixel
            will be considered foreground (region(s) of interest) or background.
            A higher threshold value will result in only the brightest regions being identified,
            whereas a lower threshold value will include dim regions. You can have the threshold
            automatically calculated from a choice of several methods,
            or you can enter a number manually between 0 and 1 for the threshold.

            <p>Both the automatic and manual options have advantages and disadvantages.

            An automatically-calculated threshold adapts to changes in
            lighting/staining conditions between images and is usually more
            robust/accurate. In the vast majority of cases, an automatic method
            is sufficient to achieve the desired thresholding, once the proper
            method is selected.</dd>
            <dd>In contrast, an advantage of a manually-entered number is that it treats every image identically,
            so use this option when you have a good sense for what the threshold should be
            across all images. To help determine the choice of threshold manually, you
            can inspect the pixel intensities in an image of your choice.

            conditions between images. </dd>
            <dd>The automatic methods may ocasionally produce a poor
            threshold for unusual or artifactual images. It also takes a small amount of time to
            calculate, which can add to processing time for analysis runs on a large
            number of images.</dd>
            </dl></p>

            <p>The threshold that is used for each image is recorded as a per-image
            measurement, so if you are surprised by unusual measurements from
            one of your images, you might check whether the automatically calculated
            threshold was unusually high or low compared to the other images. See the
            <b>FlagImage</b> module if you would like to flag an image based on the threshold
            value.</p>

            <p>There are a number of methods for finding thresholds automatically:
            <ul>
            <li><i>%(TM_OTSU)s:</i> This approach calculates the threshold separating the
            two classes of pixels (foreground and background) by minimizing the variance within the
            each class.
            <dl>
            <dd><img src="memory:%(PROTIP_RECOMEND_ICON)s">&nbsp;
            This method is a good initial approach if you do not know much about
            the image characteristics of all the images in your experiment,
            especially if the percentage of the image covered by foreground varies
            substantially from image to image. </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
            <dd><img src="memory:%(TECH_NOTE_ICON)s">&nbsp;
            Our implementation of Otsu's method allows for assigning the threshold value based on
            splitting the image into either two classes (foreground and background) or three classes
            (foreground, mid-level, and background). See the help below for more details.</dd>
            </dl>
            </li>

            <li><i>Mixture of Gaussian (%(TM_MOG)s):</i>This function assumes that the
            pixels in the image belong to either a background class or a foreground
            class, using an initial guess of the fraction of the image that is
            covered by foreground.

            foreground percentage is not near 50%%.</dd>

            This method is our own version of a Mixture of Gaussians
            algorithm (<i>O. Friman, unpublished</i>). Essentially, there are two steps:
            <ol><li>First, a number of Gaussian distributions are estimated to
            match the distribution of pixel intensities in the image. Currently
            three Gaussian distributions are fitted, one corresponding to a
            background class, one corresponding to a foreground class, and one
            distribution for an intermediate class. The distributions are fitted
            using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, a procedure referred
            to as Mixture of Gaussians modeling. </li>
            <li>When the three Gaussian distributions have been fitted, a decision
            is made whether the intermediate class more closely models the background pixels
            or foreground pixels, based on the estimated fraction provided by the user.</li></ol></dd>
            </dl>
            </li>

            <li><i>%(TM_BACKGROUND)s:</i> This method simply finds the mode of the
            histogram of the image, which is assumed to be the background of the
            image, and chooses a threshold at twice that value (which you can
            adjust with a Threshold Correction Factor; see below).  The calculation
	    includes those pixels between 2%% and 98%% of the intensity range.
            <dl>
            <dd><img src="memory:%(PROTIP_RECOMEND_ICON)s">&nbsp;
            This thresholding method is appropriate for images in which most of the image is background.
	    It can also be helpful if your images vary in overall brightness, but the objects of
            interest are consistently <i>N</i> times brighter than the background level of the image.</dd>
            </dl></li>

            <li><i>%(TM_ROBUST_BACKGROUND)s:</i> Much like the %(TM_BACKGROUND)s: method, this method is
	    also simple and assumes that the background distribution
	    approximates a Gaussian by trimming the brightest and dimmest 5%% of pixel
	    intensities. It then calculates the mean and standard deviation of the
            remaining pixels and calculates the threshold as the mean + 2 times
            the standard deviation.
