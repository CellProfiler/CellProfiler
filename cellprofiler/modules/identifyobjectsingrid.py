IdentifyObjectsInGrid
=====================

**IdentifyObjectsInGrid** identifies objects within each section of a
grid that has been defined by the **DefineGrid** module.

This module identifies objects that are contained within in a grid
pattern, allowing you to measure the objects using **Measure** modules.
It requires you to have defined a grid earlier in the pipeline, using
the **DefineGrid** module. For several of the automatic options, you
will need to enter the names of previously identified objects.
Typically, this module is used to refine locations and/or shapes of
objects of interest that you roughly identified in a previous
**Identify** module. Within this module, objects are re-numbered
according to the grid definitions rather than their original numbering
from the earlier **Identify** module. If placing the objects within the
grid is impossible for some reason (the grid compartments are too close
together to fit the proper sized circles, for example) the grid will
fail and processing will be canceled unless you choose to re-use a grid
from a previous successful image cycle. *Special note on saving images:*
You can use the settings in this module to pass objects along to
the object processing module **ConvertToImage** and then save them with the
**SaveImages** module.

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Image measurements:**

-  *Count:* The number of objects identified.

**Object measurements:**

-  *Location\_X, Location\_Y:* The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the center
   of mass of the identified objects.
-  *Number:* The numeric label assigned to each identified object
   according to the arrangement order you specified.

Use this setting to choose the method to be used to determine the grid
objects’ shapes and locations:

-  *%(SHAPE_RECTANGLE)s:* Each object will be created as a rectangle,
   completely occupying the entire grid compartment (rectangle). This
   option creates the rectangular objects based solely on the grid’s
   specifications, not on any previously identified guiding objects.
-  *%(SHAPE_CIRCLE_FORCED)s:* Each object will be created as a circle,
   centered in the middle of each grid compartment. This option places
   the circular objects’ locations based solely on the grid’s
   specifications, not on any previously identified guiding objects. The
   radius of all circles in a grid will be constant for the entire grid
   in each image cycle, and can be determined automatically for each
   image cycle based on the average radius of previously identified
   guiding objects for that image cycle, or instead it can be specified
   as a single radius for all circles in all grids in the entire
   analysis run.
-  *%(SHAPE_CIRCLE_NATURAL)s:* Each object will be created as a
   circle, and each circle’s location within its grid compartment will
   be determined based on the location of any previously identified
   guiding objects within that grid compartment. Thus, if a guiding
   object lies within a particular grid compartment, that object’s
   center will be the center of the created circular object. If no
   guiding objects lie within a particular grid compartment, the
   circular object is placed within the center of that grid compartment.
   If more than one guiding object lies within the grid compartment,
   they will be combined and the centroid of this combined object will
   be the location of the created circular object. Note that guiding
   objects whose centers are close to the grid edge are ignored.
-  *%(SHAPE_NATURAL)s:* Within each grid compartment, the object will
   be identified based on combining all of the parts of guiding objects,
   if any, that fall within the grid compartment. Note that guiding
   objects whose centers are close to the grid edge are ignored. If a
   guiding object does not exist within a grid compartment, an object
   consisting of one single pixel in the middle of the grid compartment
   will be created.

        Overriding modules should return a tuple of setting_values,
        variable_revision_number and True if upgraded to CP 2.0, otherwise
        they should leave things as-is so that the caller can report
        an error.
