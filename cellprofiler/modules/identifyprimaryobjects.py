IdentifyPrimaryObjects
======================

**IdentifyPrimaryObjects** identifies biological objects of interest.
It requires grayscale images containing bright objects on a dark background.
Incoming images must be 2D (including 2D slices of 3D images);
please use the **Watershed** module for identification of objects in 3D.

What is a primary object?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

{DEFINITION_OBJECT}

We define an object as *primary* when it can be found in an image without needing the
assistance of another cellular feature as a reference. For example:

-  The nuclei of cells are usually more easily identifiable than whole-
   cell stains due to their
   more uniform morphology, high contrast relative to the background
   when stained, and good separation between adjacent nuclei. These
   qualities typically make them appropriate candidates for primary
   object identification.
-  In contrast, whole-cell stains often yield irregular intensity patterns
   and are lower-contrast with more diffuse staining, making them more
   challenging to identify than nuclei without some supplemental image
   information being provided. In addition, cells often touch or even overlap
   their neighbors making it harder to delineate the cell borders. For
   these reasons, cell bodies are better suited for *secondary object*
   identification, because they are best identified by using a
   previously-identified primary object (i.e, the nuclei) as a
   reference. See the **IdentifySecondaryObjects** module for details on
   how to do this.

What do I need as input?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use this module, you will need to make sure that your input image has
the following qualities:

-  The image should be grayscale.
-  The foreground (i.e, regions of interest) are lighter than the
   background.
-  The image should be 2D. 2D slices of 3D images are acceptable if the
   image has not been loaded as volumetric in the **NamesAndTypes**
   module. For volumetric analysis
   of 3D images, please see the **Watershed** module.

If this is not the case, other modules can be used to pre-process the
images to ensure they are in the proper form:

-  If the objects in your images are dark on a light background, you
   should invert the images using the Invert operation in the
   **ImageMath** module.
-  If you are working with color images, they must first be converted to
   grayscale using the **ColorToGray** module.
-  If your images are brightfield/phase/DIC, they may be processed with the
   **EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures** module with its "*Texture*" or "*DIC*" settings.
-  If you struggle to find effective settings for this module, you may
   want to check our `tutorial`_ on preprocessing these images with
   ilastik prior to using them in CellProfiler.

What are the advanced settings?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**IdentifyPrimaryObjects** allows you to tweak your settings in many ways;
so many that it can often become confusing where you should start. This is
typically the most important but complex step in creating a good pipeline,
so do not be discouraged: other modules are easier to configure!
Using **IdentifyPrimaryObjects** with *'Use advanced settings?'* set to *'No'*
allows you to quickly try to identify your objects based only their typical size;
CellProfiler will then use its built-in defaults to decide how to set the
threshold and how to break clumped objects apart. If you are happy with the
results produced by the default settings, you can then move on to
construct the rest of your pipeline; if not, you can set
*'Use advanced settings?'* to *'Yes'* which will allow you to fully tweak and
customize all the settings.

What do I get as output?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A set of primary objects are produced by this module, which can be used
in downstream modules for measurement purposes or other operations. See
the section `"Measurements made by this module" <#Measurements_made_by_thismodule>`__ below
for the measurements that are produced directly by this module. Once the module
has finished processing, the module display window will show the
following panels:

-  *Upper left:* The raw, original image.
-  *Upper right:* The identified objects shown as a color image where
   connected pixels that belong to the same object are assigned the same
   color (*label image*). Note that assigned colors
   are arbitrary; they are used simply to help you distingush the
   various objects.
-  *Lower left:* The raw image overlaid with the colored outlines of the
   identified objects. Each object is assigned one of three (default)
   colors:

   -  Green: Acceptable; passed all criteria
   -  Magenta: Discarded based on size
   -  Yellow: Discarded due to touching the border

   If you need to change the color defaults, you can make adjustments in
   *File > Preferences*.
-  *Lower right:* A table showing some of the settings used by the module
   in order to produce the objects shown. Some of these are as you
   specified in settings; others are calculated by the module itself.

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Image measurements:**

-  *Count:* The number of primary objects identified.
-  *OriginalThreshold:* The global threshold for the image.
-  *FinalThreshold:* For the global threshold methods, this value is the
   same as *OriginalThreshold*. For the adaptive or per-object methods,
   this value is the mean of the local thresholds.
-  *WeightedVariance:* The sum of the log-transformed variances of the
   foreground and background pixels, weighted by the number of pixels in
   each distribution.
-  *SumOfEntropies:* The sum of entropies computed from the foreground
   and background distributions.

**Object measurements:**

-  *Location\_X, Location\_Y:* The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the
   primary object centroids. The centroid is calculated as the center of
   mass of the binary representation of the object.

Technical notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CellProfiler contains a modular three-step strategy to identify objects
even if they touch each other ("declumping"). It is based on previously
published
algorithms (*Malpica et al., 1997; Meyer and Beucher, 1990; Ortiz de
Solorzano et al., 1999; Wahlby, 2003; Wahlby et al., 2004*). Choosing
different options for each of these three steps allows CellProfiler to
flexibly analyze a variety of different types of objects. The module has
many options, which vary in terms of speed and sophistication. More
detail can be found in the Settings section below. Here are the three
steps, using an example where nuclei are the primary objects:

#. CellProfiler determines whether a foreground region is an individual
   nucleus or two or more clumped nuclei.
#. The edges of nuclei are identified, using thresholding if the object
   is a single, isolated nucleus, and using more advanced options if the
   object is actually two or more nuclei that touch each other.
#. Some identified objects are discarded or merged together if they fail
   to meet certain your specified criteria. For example, partial objects
   at the border of the image can be discarded, and small objects can be
   discarded or merged with nearby larger ones. A separate module,
   **FilterObjects**, can further refine the identified nuclei, if
   desired, by excluding objects that are a particular size, shape,
   intensity, or texture.

This setting is crucial for two reasons: first, the module uses it to
calculate certain automatic settings in order to identify your objects
of interest properly (see below). Second, when used in conjunction with the
*{EXCLUDE_SIZE_SETTING_TEXT}* setting below, you can choose to remove
objects outside the size range you provide here.

|image0| The units used here are pixels so that it is easy to zoom in
on objects and determine typical diameters. {HELP_ON_MEASURING_DISTANCES}

A few important notes:

-  The other settings that make use of the minimum object size entered
   here (whether the "*{EXCLUDE_SIZE_SETTING_TEXT}*" setting is used or
   not) are:

   -  "*{AUTOMATIC_SMOOTHING_SETTING_TEXT}*"
   -  "*{AUTOMATIC_MAXIMA_SUPPRESSION_SETTING_TEXT}*"

-  For non-round objects, the diameter you should enter here is actually
   the “equivalent diameter”, i.e., the diameter of a circle with the
   same area as the object.

This setting allows you to choose the method that is used to distinguish
between individual objects that are touching each other (and not properly
delineated as two objects by thresholding alone). In other words, this
setting allows you to “declump” a large, merged object into individual objects
of interest. To decide between these methods, you can run Test mode to
see the results of each.

This setting allows you to choose the method that is used to draw the
line between segmented objects, provided that you have chosen to declump
the objects. To decide between these methods, you can run Test mode to
see the results of each.

-  *{WA_INTENSITY}:* Works best where the dividing lines between
   clumped objects are dimmer than the remainder of the objects.

   **Technical description:** Using the previously identified local
   maxima as seeds, this method is a watershed (*Vincent and Soille,
   1991*) on the intensity image.

-  *{WA_SHAPE}:* Dividing lines between clumped objects are based on
   the shape of the clump. For example, when a clump contains two
   objects, the dividing line will be placed where indentations occur
   between the two objects. The intensity patterns in the original image
   are largely irrelevant: the cells need not be dimmer along the lines
   between clumped objects. Technical description: Using the previously
   identified local maxima as seeds, this method is a watershed on the
   distance-transformed thresholded image.
-  *{WA_PROPAGATE}:* This method uses a propagation algorithm instead
   of a watershed. The image is ignored and the pixels are assigned to
   the objects by repeatedly adding unassigned pixels to the objects
   that are immediately adjacent to them. This method is suited in cases
   such as objects with branching extensions, for instance neurites,
   where the goal is to trace outward from the cell body along the
   branch, assigning pixels in the branch along the way. See the help
   for the **IdentifySecondaryObjects** module for more details on this
   method.
-  *{WA_NONE}*: If objects are well separated and bright relative to
   the background, it may be unnecessary to attempt to separate clumped
   objects. Using the very fast *{WA_NONE}* option, a simple threshold
   will be used to identify objects.

This setting, along with the *Minimum allowed distance between local
maxima* setting, affects whether objects close to each other are
considered a single object or multiple objects. It does not affect the
dividing lines between an object and the background.

Please note that this smoothing setting is applied after thresholding,
and is therefore distinct from the threshold smoothing method setting
above, which is applied *before* thresholding.

The size of the smoothing filter is automatically calculated based on

Reducing the texture of objects by increasing the smoothing increases
the chance that each real, distinct object has only one peak of
intensity but also increases the chance that two distinct objects will
be recognized as only one object. Note that increasing the size of the
smoothing filter increases the processing time exponentially.

Enter 0 to prevent any image smoothing in certain cases; for example,
for low resolution images with small objects ( < ~5 pixels in
diameter).
