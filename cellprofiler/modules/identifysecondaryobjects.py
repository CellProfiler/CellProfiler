__doc__ = '''<b>Identify Secondary Objects</b> identifies objects (e.g., cell edges) using
objects identified by another module (e.g., nuclei) as a starting point.
<hr>
<h4>What is a secondary object?</h4>
In CellProfiler, we use the term <i>object</i> as a generic term to refer to an identifed
feature in an image, usually a cellular subcompartment of some kind (for example,
nuclei, cells, colonies, worms). We define an object as <i>secondary</i> when it can be
found in an image by using another cellular feature as a reference for guiding detection.

<p>For densely-packed cells
(such as those in a confluent monolayer), determining the cell borders using a cell body stain
can be quite difficult since they often have irregular intensity patterns and are lower-contrast
with more diffuse staining. In addition, cells often touch their neighbors making it harder to
delineate the cell borders. It is often easier to identify an organelle which is well separated
spatially (such as the nucleus) as an object first and then use that object to guide the detection
of the cell borders. See the <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> module for details on how to identify
a primary object.</p>

In order to identify the edges of secondary objects, this module performs two tasks:
<ol>
<li>Finds the dividing lines between secondary objects which touch each other.</li>
<li>Finds the dividing lines between the secondary objects and the
background of the image. In most cases, this is done by thresholding the image stained
for the secondary objects.</li>
</ol>

<h4>What do I need as input?</h4>
This module identifies secondary objects based on two types of input:
<ol>
<li>An <i>object</i> (e.g., nuclei) identified from a prior module. These are typically produced
by an <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> module, but any object produced by another module may be
selected for this purpose.</li>
<li>An <i>image</i> highlighting the image features defining the cell edges. This is typically
a fluorescent stain for the cell body, membrane or cytoskeleton (e.g., phalloidin staining for actin).
However, any image which produces these features can be used for this purpose. For example, an image
processing module might be used to transform a brightfield image into one which captures the characteristics of a cell
body flourescent stain.</li>
</ol>

<h4>What do the settings mean?</h4>
See below for help on the individual settings. The following icons are used to call attention to
key items:
<ul>
<li><img src="memory:%(PROTIP_RECOMEND_ICON)s">&nbsp;Our recommendation or example use case
for which a particular setting is best used.</li>
<li><img src="memory:%(PROTIP_AVOID_ICON)s">&nbsp;Indicates a condition under which
a particular setting may not work well.</li>
<li><img src="memory:%(TECH_NOTE_ICON)s">&nbsp;Technical note. Provides more
detailed information on the setting, if interested.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What do I get as output?</h4>
A set of secondary objects are produced by this module, which can be used in downstream modules
for measurement purposes or other operations. Because each primary object is used as the starting point
for producing a corresponding secondary object, keep in mind the following points:
<ul>
<li>The primary object will always be completely contained
within a secondary object. For example, nuclei are completely enclosed within identified cells
stained for actin.</li>
<li>There will always be at most one secondary object for each primary object.</li>
</ul>
See the section <a href="#Available_measurements">"Available measurements"</a> below for
the measurements that are produced by this module.

Once the module has finished processing, the module display window
will show the following panels:
<ul>
<li><i>Upper left:</i> The raw, original image.</li>
<li><i>Upper right:</i> The identified objects shown as a color
image where connected pixels that belong to the same object are assigned the same
color (<i>label image</i>). It is important to note that assigned colors are
arbitrary; they are used simply to help you distingush the various objects. </li>
<li><i>Lower left:</i> The raw image overlaid with the colored outlines of the
identified secondary objects. The objects are shown with the following colors:
<ul>
<li>Magenta: Secondary objects</li>
<li>Green: Primary objects</li>
</ul>
If you need to change the color defaults, you can
make adjustments in <i>File > Preferences</i>.</li>
<li><i>Lower right:</i> A table showing some of the settings selected by the user, as well as
those calculated by the module in order to produce the objects shown.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Available_measurements">
<h4>Available measurements</h4>
<b>Image measurements:</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Count:</i> The number of secondary objects identified.</li>
<li><i>OriginalThreshold:</i> The global threshold for the image.</li>
<li><i>FinalThreshold:</i> For the global threshold methods, this value is the
same as <i>OriginalThreshold</i>. For the adaptive or per-object methods, this
value is the mean of the local thresholds.</li>
<li><i>WeightedVariance:</i> The sum of the log-transformed variances of the
foreground and background pixels, weighted by the number of pixels in
each distribution.</li>
<li><i>SumOfEntropies:</i> The sum of entropies computed from the foreground and
background distributions.</li>
</ul>

<b>Object measurements:</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Parent:</i> The identity of the primary object associated with each secondary
object.</li>
<li><i>Location_X, Location_Y:</i> The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the center of
mass of the identified secondary objects.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technical notes</h4>
The <i>Propagation</i> algorithm is the default approach for secondary object creation,
creating each primary object as a "seed" guided by the input image and limited to the
foreground region as determined by the chosen thresholding method. &lambda; is
a regularization parameter; see the help for the setting for more details. Propagation
of secondary object labels is by the shortest path to an adjacent primary object
from the starting ("seeding") primary object. The seed-to-pixel distances are
calculated as the sum of absolute differences in a 3x3 (8-connected) image
neighborhood, combined with &lambda; via sqrt(differences<sup>2</sup> + &lambda;<sup>2</sup>).

            <p>There are several methods available to find the dividing lines
            between secondary objects which touch each other:
            <ul>
            <li><i>%(M_PROPAGATION)s:</i> This method will find dividing lines
            between clumped objects where the image stained for secondary objects
            shows a change in staining (i.e., either a dimmer or a brighter line).
            Smoother lines work better, but unlike the Watershed method, small gaps
            are tolerated. This method is considered an improvement on the
            traditional <i>Watershed</i> method. The dividing lines between objects are
            determined by a combination of the distance to the nearest primary object
            and intensity gradients. This algorithm uses local image similarity to
            guide the location of boundaries between cells. Boundaries are
            preferentially placed where the image's local appearance changes
            perpendicularly to the boundary (<i>Jones et al, 2005</i>).</li>

            <li><i>%(M_WATERSHED_G)s:</i> This method uses the watershed algorithm
            (<i>Vincent and Soille, 1991</i>) to assign
            pixels to the primary objects which act as seeds for the watershed.
            In this variant, the watershed algorithm operates on the Sobel
            transformed image which computes an intensity gradient. This method
            works best when the image intensity drops off or increases rapidly
            near the boundary between cells.
            </li>
            <li><i>%(M_WATERSHED_I)s:</i> This method is similar to the above,
            but it uses the inverted intensity of the image for the watershed.
            The areas of lowest intensity will form the boundaries between
            cells. This method works best when there is a saddle of relatively
            low intensity at the cell-cell boundary.
            </li>
            <li><i>Distance:</i> In this method, the edges of the primary
            objects are expanded a specified distance to create the secondary
            objects. For example, if nuclei are labeled but there is no stain to help
            locate cell edges, the nuclei can simply be expanded in order to estimate
            the cell's location. This is often called the "doughnut" or "annulus" or
            "ring" approach for identifying the cytoplasm.
            There are two methods that can be used:
            <ul>
            <li><i>%(M_DISTANCE_N)s</i>: In this method, the image of the secondary
            staining is not used at all; the expanded objects are the
            final secondary objects.</li>
            <li><i>%(M_DISTANCE_B)s</i>: Thresholding of the secondary staining image is used to eliminate background
            regions from the secondary objects. This allows the extent of the
            secondary objects to be limited to a certain distance away from the edge
            of the primary objects without including regions of background.</li></ul></li>

            The regularization factor &lambda; can be anywhere in the range 0 to infinity.
            This method takes two factors into account when deciding where to draw
            the dividing line between two touching secondary objects: the distance to
            the nearest primary object, and the intensity of the secondary object
            image. The regularization factor controls the balance between these two
            considerations:
            <ul>
            <li>A &lambda; value of 0 means that the distance to the nearest
            primary object is ignored and the decision is made entirely on the
            intensity gradient between the two competing primary objects. </li>
            <li>Larger values of &lambda; put more and more weight on the distance between the two objects.
            This relationship is such that small changes in &lambda; will have fairly different
            results (e.,g 0.01 vs 0.001). However, the intensity image is almost completely
            ignored at &lambda; much greater than 1.</li>
            <li>At infinity, the result will look like %(M_DISTANCE_B)s, masked to the
