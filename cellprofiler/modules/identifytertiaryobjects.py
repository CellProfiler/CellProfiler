'''<b>Identify Tertiary Objects</b> identifies tertiary objects (e.g., cytoplasm) by removing smaller primary
objects (e.g. nuclei) from larger secondary objects (e.g., cells), leaving a ring shape.
<hr>
<h4>What is a tertiary object?</h4>
In CellProfiler, we use the term <i>object</i> as a generic term to refer to an identifed
feature in an image, usually a cellular subcompartment of some kind (for example,
nuclei, cells, colonies, worms).
We define an object as <i>tertiary</i> when it is identified by using a prior primary and
secondary objects for reference. A common use case is when nuclei have been found using
<b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> and the cell body has been found using <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>
but measurements from the cytoplasm, the region outside the nucleus but within the cell body,
are desired. This module may be used to define the cytoplasm as an new object.

<h4>What do I need as input?</h4>
This module will take the smaller identified objects and remove them from
the larger identified objects. For example, "subtracting" the nuclei from
the cells will leave just the cytoplasm, the properties of which can then
be measured by downstream <b>Measure</b> modules. The larger objects should therefore be
equal in size or larger than the smaller objects and must completely
contain the smaller objects; <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b> will produce objects that
satisfy this constraint. Ideally, both inputs should be objects produced by prior
<b>Identify</b> modules.

<h4>What do I get as output?</h4>
A set of tertiary objects are produced by this module, which can be used in
downstream modules for measurement purposes or other operations. Because each
tertiary object is produced from primary and secondary objects, there will
always be at most one secondary object for each primary object.
See the section <a href="#Available_measurements">"Available measurements"</a> below for
the measurements that are produced by this module.

<p>Note that creating subregions using this module can result in objects with
a single label that nonetheless are not contiguous. This may lead to unexpected
results when running measurment modules such as <b>MeasureObjectSizeShape</b>
because calculations of the perimeter, aspect ratio, solidity, etc. typically
make sense only for contiguous objects. Other modules, such as <b>MeasureImageIntensity</b> and
<b>MeasureTexture</b> modules, are not affected and will yield expected results.

<h4>Available measurements</h4>
<b>Image measurements:</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Count:</i> The number of tertiary objects identified.</li>
</ul>

<b>Object measurements:</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Parent:</i> The identity of the primary object and secondary object associated
with each tertiary object.</li>
<li><i>Location_X, Location_Y:</i> The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the center of mass of the
identified tertiary objects.</li>
</ul>
