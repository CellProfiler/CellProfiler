'''<b>Identify Tertiary Objects</b> identifies tertiary objects (e.g., cytoplasm) by removing smaller primary
objects (e.g. nuclei) from larger secondary objects (e.g., cells), leaving a ring shape
<hr>

This module will take the smaller identified objects and remove them from
the larger identified objects. For example, "subtracting" the nuclei from
the cells will leave just the cytoplasm, the properties of which can then
be measured by <b>Measure</b> modules. The larger objects should therefore be
equal in size or larger than the smaller objects and must completely
contain the smaller objects.  Both inputs should be objects produced by
<b>Identify</b> modules, not grayscale images.

<p><i>Note:</i> Creating subregions using this module can result in objects that
are not contiguous, which does not cause problems when running the
<b>MeasureImageIntensity</b> and <b>MeasureTexture</b> modules, but does cause 
problems when running the <b>MeasureObjectSizeShape</b> module because calculations 
of the perimeter, aspect ratio, solidity, etc. cannot be made for noncontiguous
objects.

<i>Special note on saving images:</i> You can use the settings in this module to pass object outlines along object
outlines can be passed along to the module <b>OverlayOutlines</b> and then
save them with the <b>SaveImages</b> module. You can also pass the identified objects themselves along to the object
processing module <b>ConvertToImage</b> and then save them with the <b>SaveImages</b> module.

<h4>Available measurements</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Image features:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Count:</i> The number of tertiary objects identified.</li>
</ul>
</li>         
<li><i>Object features:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Parent:</i> The identity of the primary object and secondary object associated 
with each tertiary object.</li>
<li><i>Location_X, Location_Y:</i> The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the center of mass of the 
identified tertiary objects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
