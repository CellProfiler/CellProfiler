MaskObjects
===========

**MaskObjects** removes objects outside of a specified region or
regions.

This module allows you to delete the objects or portions of objects that
are outside of a region (mask) you specify. For example, after
identifying nuclei and tissue regions in previous **Identify** modules,
you might want to exclude all nuclei that are outside of a tissue
region.

If using a masking image, the mask is composed of the foreground (white
portions); if using a masking object, the mask is composed of the area
within the object. You can choose to remove only the portion of each
object that is outside of the region, remove the whole object if it is
partially or fully outside of the region, or retain the whole object
unless it is fully outside of the region.

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Parent object measurements:**

-  *Count:* The number of new masked objects created from each parent
   object.

**Masked object measurements:**

-  *Parent:* The label number of the parent object.
-  *Location_X, Location_Y:* The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the center
   of mass of the masked objects.
