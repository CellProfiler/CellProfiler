'''<b>Measure Image Quality</b> measures features that indicate image quality, 
including measurements of blur (poor focus) and the percentage
of pixels in the image that are minimal and maximal (i.e., saturated)
<hr>

Please note that for best results, this module should be applied to the original raw images, 
as opposed to images that already been corrected for illumination.
 
<h4>Available measurements</h4>  
<ul>
<li><i>PercentMaximal:</i> Percent of pixels at the maximum intensity value of the image</li>
<li><i>PercentMinimal:</i> Percent of pixels at the minimum intensity value of the image</li>
<li><i>FocusScore:</i> A measure of the intensity variance across image</li>
<li><i>LocalFocusScore:</i> A measure of the intensity variance between image parts</li>
<li><i>Threshold:</i> The automatically calculated threshold for each image for the 
thresholding method of choice.</li>
<li><i>MagnitudeLogLogSlope, PowerLogLogSlope:</i> The slope of the log-log magnitude and power spectra.</li>
</ul>

                                            (higher Focus Score = better focus = less blurry). This calculation is slow, so it is optional. The score 
                                            is calculated using the normalized variance. We used this algorithm because it
                                            was ranked best in this paper:

                                               Selecting the optimal focus algorithm," <i>Microscopy Research and
                                               Technique</i> 65:139-149 (2004).<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The calculation of the focus score is as follows:<br>
                                            [m,n] = size(Image);<br>
                                            MeanImageValue = mean(Image(:));<br>
                                            SquaredNormalizedImage = (Image-MeanImageValue).^2;<br>
                                            FocusScore{ImageNumber} = ...<br>
                                               sum(SquaredNormalizedImage(:))/(m*n*MeanImageValue);<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The above score is designed to determine which image of a particular field of view shows the 
                                            best focus (assuming the overall intensity and the number of objects in the image is 
                                            constant); it is not necessarily intended to compare images of different 
                                            fields of view, although it may be useful for this to some degree. 
                                            The Local Focus Score is a local version of the Focus Score, which is 
                                            potentially more useful for comparing focus between images of different fields of view. However, 
                                            like the Focus Score, the measurement should be used with caution 
                                            because it may fail to correspond well to the blurriness of images of 
                                            different fields of view, depending on the conditions.
