'''<b>Measure Object Neighbors</b> calculates how many neighbors each 
object has and records various properties about the neighbors' relationships, 
including the percentage of an object's edge pixels that touch a neighbor
<hr>

Given an image with objects identified (e.g., nuclei or cells), this
module determines how many neighbors each object has. You can specify 
the distance within which objects should be considered neighbors, or 
that objects are only considered neighbors if they are directly touching.

<h4>Available measurements</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>NumberOfNeighbors:</i> Number of neighbor objects
<li><i>PercentTouching:</i> Percent of the object's boundary pixels that touch 
neighbors, after the objects have been expanded to the specified distance</li>
<li><i>FirstClosestObjectNumber:</i> The index of the closest object.</li>
<li><i>FirstClosestDistance:</i> The distance to the closest object.</li>
<li><i>SecondClosestObjectNumber:</i> The index of the second closest object.</li>
<li><i>SecondClosestDistance:</i> The distance to the second closest object.</li>
<li><i>AngleBetweenNeighbors:</i> The angle formed with the object center as the 
vertex and the first and second closest object centers along the vectors.</li>
</ul>

You can retain the image of objects colored by numbers of neighbors or 
colored by the percentage of pixels that are touching other objects.
CellProfiler creates a color image using the color map you choose. Use
the <b>SaveImages</b> module to save the image to a file. See the settings help 
for further details on interpreting the output.

<h3>Technical notes</h3> 
Objects discarded via modules such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> or 
<b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b> will still register as a neighbors for the purposes
of accurate measurement. For instance, if an object touches a single object and 
that object had been discarded, <i>NumberOfNeighbors</i> will be positive, but 
there will not be a corresponding <i>ClosestObjectNumber<i>.
