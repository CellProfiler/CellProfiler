MeasureObjectNeighbors
======================

**MeasureObjectNeighbors** calculates how many neighbors each object
has and records various properties about the neighbors’ relationships,
including the percentage of an object’s edge pixels that touch a
neighbor.

Given an image with objects identified (e.g., nuclei or cells), this
module determines how many neighbors each object has. You can specify
the distance within which objects should be considered neighbors, or
that objects are only considered neighbors if they are directly
touching.

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Object measurements**

-  *NumberOfNeighbors:* Number of neighbor objects.
-  *PercentTouching:* Percent of the object’s boundary pixels that touch
   neighbors, after the objects have been expanded to the specified
   distance.
-  *FirstClosestObjectNumber:* The index of the closest object.
-  *FirstClosestDistance:* The distance to the closest object (in units
   of pixels).
-  *SecondClosestObjectNumber:* The index of the second closest object.
-  *SecondClosestDistance:* The distance to the second closest object (in units
   of pixels).
-  *AngleBetweenNeighbors:* The angle formed with the object center as
   the vertex and the first and second closest object centers along the
   vectors.

**Object relationships:** The identity of the neighboring objects, for
each object. Since per-object output is one-to-one and neighbors
relationships are often many-to-one, they may be saved as a separate
file in **ExportToSpreadsheet** by selecting *Object relationships* from
the list of objects to export.

Technical notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Objects discarded via modules such as **IdentifyPrimaryObjects** or
**IdentifySecondaryObjects** will still register as neighbors for the
purposes of accurate measurement. For instance, if an object touches a
single object and that object had been discarded, *NumberOfNeighbors*
will be positive, but there may not be a corresponding
*ClosestObjectNumber*. This can be disabled in module settings.
