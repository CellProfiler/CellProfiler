MeasureObjectSkeleton
=====================

**MeasureObjectSkeleton** measures information for any branching structures,
such as neurons, root or branch systems, vasculature, or any skeletonized
system that originates from a single point (such as neurites branching from
a single nucleus/soma).

This module measures the number of trunks and branches for each branching system
in an image. The module takes a skeletonized image of the object plus
previously identified seed objects (for instance, each neuron's soma) and
finds the number of axon or dendrite trunks that emerge from the soma
and the number of branches along the axons and dendrites. Note that the
seed objects must be both smaller than the skeleton, and touching the
skeleton, in order to be counted.

The typical approach for this module is the following:

-  Identify a seed object. This object is typically a nucleus,
   identified with a module such as **IdentifyPrimaryObjects**.
-  Identify a larger object that touches or encloses this seed object.
   For example, the neuron cell can be grown outwards from the initial
   seed nuclei using **IdentifySecondaryObjects**.
-  Use the **Morph** module to skeletonize the secondary objects.
-  Finally, the primary objects and the skeleton objects are used as
   inputs to **MeasureObjectSkeleton**.

The module determines distances from the seed objects along the axons
and dendrites and assigns branchpoints based on distance to the closest
seed object when two seed objects appear to be attached to the same
dendrite or axon.

The module records *vertices* which include trunks, branchpoints, and endpoints.

Note that this module was referred to as MeasureNeurons in previous versions of CellProfiler.

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *NumberTrunks:* The number of trunks. Trunks are branchpoints that
   lie within the seed objects
-  *NumberNonTrunkBranches:* The number of non-trunk branches. Branches
   are the branchpoints that lie outside the seed objects.
-  *NumberBranchEnds*: The number of branch end-points, i.e, termini.
-  *TotalObjectSkeletonLength*: The length of all skeleton segments per object.
