<b>Measure Texture</b> measures the degree and nature of textures within objects (versus smoothness)
<hr>

This module measures the variations in grayscale images.  An object (or 
entire image) without much texture has a smooth appearance; an
object or image with a lot of texture will appear rough and show a wide 
variety of pixel intensities.

<p>This module can also measure textures of objects against grayscale images. 
Any input objects specified will have their texture measured against <i>all</i> input
images specfied, which may lead to image-object texture combinations that are unneccesary. 
If you do not want this behavior, use multiple <b>MeasureTexture</b> modules to 
specify the particular image-object measures that you want.</p>
                        

<h4>Available measurements</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Haralick Features:</i> Haralick texture features are derived from the 
co-occurrence matrix, which contains information about how image intensities in pixels with a 
certain position in relation to each other occur together. <b>MeasureTexture</b>
can measure textures at different scales; the scale you choose determines
how the co-occurrence matrix is constructed.
For example, if you choose a scale of 2, each pixel in the image (excluding
some border pixels) will be compared against the one that is two pixels to
the right. <b>MeasureTexture</b> quantizes the image into eight intensity
levels. There are then 8x8 possible ways to categorize a pixel with its
scale-neighbor. <b>MeasureTexture</b> forms the 8x8 co-occurrence matrix
by counting how many pixels and neighbors have each of the 8x8 intensity
combinations. Thirteen features are then calculated for the image by performing
mathematical operations on the co-occurrence matrix:
<ul>
<li><i>H1:</i> Angular Second Moment</li>
<li><i>H2:</i> Contrast</li>
<li><i>H3:</i> Correlation</li>
<li><i>H4:</i> Sum of Squares: Variation</li>
<li><i>H5:</i> Inverse Difference Moment</li>
<li><i>H6:</i> Sum Average</li>
<li><i>H7:</i> Sum Variance</li>
<li><i>H8:</i> Sum Entropy</li>
<li><i>H9:</i> Entropy</li>
<li><i>H10:</i> Difference Variance</li>
<li><i>H11:</i> Difference Entropy</li>
<li><i>H12:</i> Information Measure of Correlation 1</li>
<li><i>H13:</i> Information Measure of Correlation 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<i>Gabor "wavelet" features:</i> These features are similar to wavelet features, 
and they are obtained by applying so-called Gabor filters to the image. The Gabor 
filters measure the frequency content in different orientations. They are very 
similar to wavelets, and in the current context they work exactly as wavelets, but
they are not wavelets by a strict mathematical definition. The Gabor
features detect correlated bands of intensities, for instance, images of
Venetian blinds would have high scores in the horizontal orientation.

<h3>Technical notes</h3> 
<p><b>MeasureTexture</b> performs the following algorithm to compute a score
at each scale using the Gabor filter:
<ul>
<li>Divide the half-circle from 0 to 180&deg; by the number of desired
angles. For instance, if the user chooses two angles, MeasureTexture
uses 0 and 90 &deg; (horizontal and vertical) for the filter
orientations. This is the Theta value from the reference paper.</li>
<li>For each angle, compute the Gabor filter for each object in the image
at two phases separated by 90&deg; in order to account for texture
features whose peaks fall on even or odd quarter-wavelengths.</li>
<li>Multiply the image times each Gabor filter and sum over the pixels
in each object.</li>
<li>Take the square root of the sum of the squares of the two filter scores.
This results in one score per Theta.</li>
<li>Save the maximum score over all Theta as the score at the desired scale.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Changes from CellProfiler 1.0</h3>
CellProfiler 2.0 normalizes the co-occurence matrix of the Haralick features
per object by basing the intensity levels of the matrix on the maximum and
minimum intensity observed within each object. CellProfiler 1.0 normalizes
the co-occurrence matrix based on the maximum and minimum intensity observed
among all objects in each image. CellProfiler 2.0's measurements should be
more informative especially for objects whose maximum intensities vary
substantially because each object will have the full complement of levels;
in CellProfiler 1.0, only the brightest object would have the full dynamic
range. Measurements of Haralick features may differ substantially between
CellProfiler 1.0 and 2.0.

CellProfiler 1.0 constructs a single kernel for the Gabor filter operation, with
a fixed size of slightly less than the median radius of the objects in an image and 
a single exponential fall-off based on this median radius. The texture of pixels not 
covered by the kernel is not measured. In contrast, CellProfiler 2.0 performs a 
vectorized calculation of the Gabor filter, properly scaled to the size of the 
object being measured and covering all pixels in the object. CellProfiler 2.0's 
Gabor filter can be calculated at a user-selected number of angles whereas 
CellProfiler 1.0's Gabor filter is calculated only at angles of 0&deg; and 90&deg;.
