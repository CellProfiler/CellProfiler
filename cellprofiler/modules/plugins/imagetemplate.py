"""<b>ImageTemplate</b> - an example image processing module
<hr>
This is an example of a module that takes one image as an input and
produces a second image for downstream processing. You can use this as
a starting point for your own module: rename this file and put it in your
plugins directory.

The text you see here will be displayed as the help for your module. You
can use HTML markup here and in the settings text; the Python HTML control
does not fully support the HTML specification, so you may have to experiment
to get it to display correctly.
