MeasurementTemplate
===================

**MeasurementTemplate** - an example measurement module. It's recommended to
put a brief description of this module here and go into more detail below.

This is an example of a module that measures a property of an image both
for the image as a whole and for every object in the image. It
demonstrates how to load an image, how to load an object and how to
record a measurement. 

The text you see here will be displayed as the help for your module, formatted
as `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.
 
Note whether or not this module supports 3D image data and respects masks.
A module which respects masks applies an image's mask and operates only on
the image data not obscured by the mask. Update the table below to indicate 
which image processing features this module supports.

============ ============ ===============
Supports 2D? Supports 3D? Respects masks?

^^^^^^^^

Is there another **Module** that is related to this one? If so, refer
to that **Module** in this section. Otherwise, this section can be omitted.

What do I need as input?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are there any assumptions about input data someone using this module
should be made aware of? For example, is there a strict requirement that
image data be single-channel, or that the foreground is brighter than
the background? Describe any assumptions here.

This section can be omitted if there is no requirement on the input.

What do I get as output?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Describe the output of this module. This is necessary if the output is
more complex than a single image. For example, if there is data displayed
over the image then describe what the data represents.

This section can be omitted if there is no specialized output.

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Describe the measurements made by this module. Typically, measurements
are described in the following format:

**Measurement category:**

-  *MeasurementName*: A brief description of the measurement.
-  *MeasurementName*: A brief description of the measurement.

**Measurement category:**

-  *MeasurementName*: A brief description of the measurement.
-  *MeasurementName*: A brief description of the measurement.

This module makes the following measurements:

**MT** (the MeasurementTemplate category):

-  *Intensity_[IMAGE_NAME]_N[Ni]_M[Mj]*: the Zernike feature of the
   IMAGE_NAME image with radial degree Ni and Azimuthal degree Mj,
   Mj >= 0.
-  *Intensity_[IMAGE_NAME]_N[Ni]_MM[Mj]*: the Zernike feature of
   the IMAGE_NAME image with radial degree Ni and Azimuthal degree
   Mj, Mj < 0.

Technical notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Include implementation details or notes here. Additionally provide any 
other background information about this module, including definitions
or adopted conventions. Information which may be too specific to fit into
the general description should be provided here.

Omit this section if there is no technical information to mention.

The Zernike features measured here are themselves interesting. You can 
reconstruct the image of a cell, approximately, by constructing the Zernike 
functions on a unit circle, multiplying the real parts by the corresponding 
features for positive M, multiplying the imaginary parts by the corresponding 
features for negative M and adding real and imaginary parts.
