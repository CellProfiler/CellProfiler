'''<b>MeasurementTemplate</b> - an example measurement module
<hr>
This is an example of a module that measures a property of an image both
for the image as a whole and for every object in the image. It demonstrates
how to load an image, how to load an object and how to record a measurement.

The text you see here will be displayed as the help for your module. You
can use HTML markup here and in the settings text; the Python HTML control
does not fully support the HTML specification, so you may have to experiment
to get it to display correctly.
