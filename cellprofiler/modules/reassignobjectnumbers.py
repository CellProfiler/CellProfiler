'''<b>Reassign Object Numbers</b> renumbers previously identified objects.
<hr>
Objects and their measurements are associated
with each other based on their object numbers (also known as <i>labels</i>). Typically,
each object is assigned a single unique number, such that the exported measurements are ordered
by this numbering.  This module
allows the reassignment of object numbers by either unifying separate objects to share
the same label, or splitting portions of separate objects that previously had the same label.

<h4>Available measurements</h4>
<b>Parent object measurements:</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Children Count:</i> The number of relabeled objects created from each parent object.</li>
</ul>

<b>Reassigned object measurements:</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Parent:</i>The label number of the parent object.</li>
<li><i>Location_X, Location_Y:</i> The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the center of
mass of the reassigned objects.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technical notes</h4>
Reassignment means that the numerical value of every pixel within
an object (in the label matrix version of the image) gets changed, as specified by
the module settings. In order to ensure that objects are labeled consecutively
without gaps in the numbering (which other modules may depend on),
<b>ReassignObjectNumbers</b> will typically result in most of the objects having
their numbers reordered. This reassignment information is stored as a per-object measurement
with both the original input and reasigned output objects, in case you need to track the
reassignment.

            You can use one of two methods to determine whether two

            <ul>
            <li><i>%(CA_CENTROIDS)s:</i> When the module considers merging two objects,
            this method identifies the centroid of each object,
            records the intensity value of the dimmer of the two centroids,
            multiplies this value by the <i>minimum intensity fraction</i> to generate a threshold,
            and draws a line between the centroids. The method will unify the
            two objects only if the intensity of every point along the line is above
            the threshold. For instance, if the intensity
            of one centroid is 0.75 and the other is 0.50 and the <i>minimum intensity fraction</i>
            has been chosen to be 0.9, all points along the line would need to have an intensity
            of min(0.75, 0.50) * 0.9 = 0.50 * 0.9 = 0.45.<br>
            This method works well for round cells whose maximum intensity
            is in the center of the cell: a single cell that was incorrectly segmented
            into two objects will typically not have a dim line between the centroids
            of the two halves and will be correctly unified.</li>

            <li><i>%(CA_CLOSEST_POINT)s:</i> This method is useful for unifying irregularly shaped cells
            which are connected. It starts by assigning background pixels in the vicinity of the objects to the nearest
            object. Objects are then unified if each object has background pixels that are:
            <ul>
            <li>Within a distance threshold from each object;</li>
            <li>Above the minimum intensity fraction of the nearest object pixel;</li>
            <li>Adjacent to background pixels assigned to a neighboring object.</li>
            </ul>
            An example of a feature that satisfies the above constraints is a line of
            pixels that connect two neighboring objects and is roughly the same intensity
