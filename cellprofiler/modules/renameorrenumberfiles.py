'''<b>Rename or Renumber Files</b> renames or renumbers files on the hard drive.
<hr>
This file-renaming utility adjusts text within image file names.
<i><b>Be very careful with this module because its purpose is
to rename (and overwrite) files!</b></i>  You will have the opportunity to confirm
the name change for the first cycle only. If the folder containing the files
contains subfolders, the subfolders and their contents will also be
renamed. The module will not rename the file in test mode, so you should use
test mode to ensure that the settings are correct.

You can use this module to standardize the number of characters in your
file names and to remove unwanted characters from your file names. This is
especially useful if you want file names that have numbers in them to appear
in numerical order when processed by <b>NamesAndTypes</b>.<br>

While this module performs basic renaming operations, if you can extract
metadata from your images using the <b>Metadata</b> module, you may find using
metadata substitution in <b>SaveImages</b> to be more flexible. Please
refer to metadata handling for those modules and in Help for more details.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Renumbering can be useful when numbers within image filenames do
not have a minimum number of digits and thus appear out of order when
listed in some Unix/Mac OSX systems. For example, on some systems, files
would appear like this and thus be measured differently from the expected
sequence by CellProfiler:</p>
1DrosophilaDAPI_1.tif<br>
1DrosophilaDAPI_10.tif<br>
1DrosophilaDAPI_2.tif<br>
1DrosophilaDAPI_3.tif<br>
1DrosophilaDAPI_4.tif<br>
<p>To renumber the files in the expected order, the numeric digits need to be
padded with zeros to the same length. In this case, you would want to:
<ul>
<li>Retain 16 characters at the beginning ("1DrosophilaDAPI_").</li>
<li>Retain 4 characters at the end (".tif").</li>
<li>"Renumber" as the handling method using 3 numerical digits.</li>
<li>Set the text addition box to "No".</li>
</ul>

<table border = "1">
<tr><td><i>Original name</i></td><td><i>New name</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_1.tif</td>  <td>1DrosophilaDAPI_001.tif</td></tr>
<tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_10.tif</td> <td>1DrosophilaDAPI_010.tif</td></tr>
<tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_100.tif</td><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_100.tif</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Renaming can be useful when file names are too long or have characters that
interfere with other software or file systems. To accomplish the following, you would
want to:
<ul>
<li>Retain 5 characters at the beginning ("1Dros")</li>
<li>Retain 8 characters at the end ("_<3-digit number>.tif", assuming they have already been renumbered)</li>
<li>Select "Delete" as the handling method</li>
<li>Check the text addition box and enter "DP" as text to place between the retained start and ending strings</li>
</ul>
<table border = "1">
<tr><td><i>Original name</i></td><td><i>New name</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_001.tif</td> <td>1DrosDP_001.tif</td></tr>
<tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_010.tif</td> <td>1DrosDP_010.tif</td></tr>
<tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_100.tif</td> <td>1DrosDP_100.tif</td></tr>
</table>
