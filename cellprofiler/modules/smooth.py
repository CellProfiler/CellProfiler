Smooth
======

**Smooth** smooths (i.e., blurs) images.

This module allows you to smooth (blur) images, which can be helpful to
remove small artifacts. Note that smoothing can be a time-consuming process.

This module smooths images using one of several filters. Fitting a
polynomial is fastest but does not allow a very tight fit compared to
the other methods:

-  *%(FIT_POLYNOMIAL)s:* This method is fastest but does not allow
   a very tight “fit” compared to the other methods. Thus, it will usually be less
   accurate. The method treats the intensity of the image
   pixels as a polynomial function of the x and y position of each
   pixel. It fits the intensity to the polynomial, *A x* :sup:`2` *+ B
   y* :sup:`2` *+ C xy + D x + E y + F*. This will produce a smoothed
   image with a single peak or trough of intensity that tapers off
   elsewhere in the image. For many microscopy images (where the
   illumination of the lamp is brightest in the center of field of
   view), this method will produce an image with a bright central region
   and dimmer edges. But, in some cases the peak/trough of the
   polynomial may actually occur outside of the image itself.
-  *%(GAUSSIAN_FILTER)s:* This method convolves the image with a
   Gaussian whose full width at half maximum is the artifact diameter
   entered. Its effect is to blur and obscure features smaller than the
   specified diameter and spread bright or dim features larger than the
   specified diameter.
-  *%(MEDIAN_FILTER)s:* This method finds the median pixel value within
   the diameter you specify. It removes bright or dim features
   that are significantly smaller than the specified diameter.
-  *%(SMOOTH_KEEPING_EDGES)s:* This method uses a bilateral filter
   which limits Gaussian smoothing across an edge while applying
   smoothing perpendicular to an edge. The effect is to respect edges in
   an image while smoothing other features. *%(SMOOTH_KEEPING_EDGES)s*
   will filter an image with reasonable speed for artifact diameters
   greater than 10 and for intensity differences greater than 0.1. The
   algorithm will consume more memory and operate more slowly as you
   lower these numbers.
-  *%(CIRCULAR_AVERAGE_FILTER)s:* This method convolves the image with
   a uniform circular averaging filter whose size is the artifact
   diameter entered. This filter is useful for re-creating an
   out-of-focus blur to an image.
-  *%(SM_TO_AVERAGE)s:* Creates a flat, smooth image where every pixel
   of the image equals the average value of the original image.

*Note, when deciding between %(MEDIAN_FILTER)s and %(GAUSSIAN_FILTER)s
we typically recommend
%(MEDIAN_FILTER)s over %(GAUSSIAN_FILTER)s because the
median is less sensitive to outliers, although the results are also
slightly less smooth and the fact that images are in the range of 0
to 1 means that outliers typically will not dominate too strongly
anyway.*
