SplitOrMergeObjects
===================

**SplitOrMergeObjects** separates or combines a set of objects that
were identified earlier in a pipeline.

Objects and their measurements are associated with each other based on
their object numbers (also known as *labels*). Typically, each object is
assigned a single unique number, such that the exported measurements are
ordered by this numbering. This module allows the reassignment of object
numbers by either merging separate objects to share the same label, or
splitting portions of separate objects that previously had the same
label.

There are many options in this module. For example, objects that share a
label, but are not touching can be relabeled into separate objects.
Objects that share a boundary can be combined into a single object.
Children of the same parent can be given the same label.

Note that this module does not *physically* connect/bridge/merge objects
that are separated by background pixels,
it simply assigns the same object number to the portions of the object.
The new, "merged" object may therefore consist of two or more unconnected
components. If you want to add pixels around objects, see
**ExpandOrShrink** or **Morph**.

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Parent object measurements:**

-  *Children Count:* The number of relabeled objects created from each
   parent object.

**Reassigned object measurements:**

-  *Parent:* The label number of the parent object.
-  *Location\_X, Location\_Y:* The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the center
   of mass of the reassigned objects.

Technical notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reassignment means that the numerical value of every pixel within an
object (in the label matrix version of the image) gets changed, as
specified by the module settings. In order to ensure that objects are
labeled consecutively without gaps in the numbering (which other modules
may depend on), **SplitOrMergeObjects** will typically result in most
of the objects having their numbers reordered. This reassignment
information is stored as a per-object measurement with both the original
input and reassigned output objects, in case you need to track the
reassignment.

*(Used only if a grayscale image is to be used as a guide for

You can use one of two methods to determine whether two objects should
merged, assuming they meet the distance criteria (as specified
above):

-  *%(CA_CENTROIDS)s:* When the module considers merging two objects,
   this method identifies the centroid of each object, records the
   intensity value of the dimmer of the two centroids, multiplies this
   value by the *minimum intensity fraction* to generate a threshold,
   and draws a line between the centroids. The method will merge the two
   objects only if the intensity of every point along the line is above
   the threshold. For instance, if the intensity of one centroid is 0.75
   and the other is 0.50 and the *minimum intensity fraction* has been
   chosen to be 0.9, all points along the line would need to have an
   intensity of min(0.75, 0.50) \* 0.9 = 0.50 \* 0.9 = 0.45.
   This method works well for round cells whose maximum intensity is in
   the center of the cell: a single cell that was incorrectly segmented
   into two objects will typically not have a dim line between the
   centroids of the two halves and will be correctly merged.
-  *%(CA_CLOSEST_POINT)s:* This method is useful for unifying
   irregularly shaped cells that are connected. It starts by assigning
   background pixels in the vicinity of the objects to the nearest
   object. Objects are then merged if each object has background pixels
   that are:

   -  Within a distance threshold from each object;
   -  Above the minimum intensity fraction of the nearest object pixel;
   -  Adjacent to background pixels assigned to a neighboring object.

   An example of a feature that satisfies the above constraints is a
   line of pixels that connects two neighboring objects and is roughly
   the same intensity as the boundary pixels of both (such as an axon
   connecting two neurons' soma).""" % globals())
