TrackObjects
============

**TrackObjects** allows tracking objects throughout sequential frames
of a series of images, so that from frame to frame each object maintains
a unique identity in the output measurements

This module must be placed downstream of a module that identifies
objects (e.g., **IdentifyPrimaryObjects**). **TrackObjects** will
associate each object with the same object in the frames before and
after. This allows the study of objects' lineages and the timing and
characteristics of dynamic events in movies.

Images in CellProfiler are processed sequentially by frame (whether
loaded as a series of images or a movie file). To process a collection
of images/movies, you will need to do the following:

-  Define each individual movie using metadata either contained within
   the image file itself or as part of the images nomenclature or folder
   structure.  Please see the **Metadata** module for more details on metadata
   collection and usage.
-  Group the movies to make sure that each image sequence is handled
   individually. Please see the **Groups** module for more details on the
   proper use of metadata for grouping.

For complete details, see *Help > Creating a Project > Loading Image Stacks and Movies*.

For an example pipeline using TrackObjects, see the CellProfiler
`Examples <http://cellprofiler.org/examples/#Tracking>`__
webpage.

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Object measurements**

-  *Label:* Each tracked object is assigned a unique identifier (label).
   Child objects resulting from a split or merge are assigned the label
   of the ancestor.
-  *ParentImageNumber, ParentObjectNumber:* The *ImageNumber* and
   *ObjectNumber* of the parent object in the prior frame. For a split,
   each child object will have the label of the object it split from.
   For a merge, the child will have the label of the closest parent.
-  *TrajectoryX, TrajectoryY:* The direction of motion (in x and y
   coordinates) of the object from the previous frame to the current
   frame.
-  *DistanceTraveled:* The distance traveled by the object from the
   previous frame to the current frame (calculated as the magnitude of
   the trajectory vectors).
-  *Displacement:* The shortest distance traveled by the object from its
   initial starting position to the position in the current frame. That
   is, it is the straight-line path between the two points.
-  *IntegratedDistance:* The total distance traveled by the object
   during the lifetime of the object.
-  *Linearity:* A measure of how linear the object trajectity is during
   the object lifetime. Calculated as (displacement from initial to
   final location)/(integrated object distance). Value is in range of
   [0,1].
-  *Lifetime:* The number of frames an objects has existed. The lifetime
   starts at 1 at the frame when an object appears, and is incremented
   with each frame that the object persists. At the final frame of the
   image set/movie, the lifetimes of all remaining objects are output.
-  *FinalAge:* Similar to *LifeTime* but is only output at the final
   frame of the object's life (or the movie ends, whichever comes
   first). At this point, the final age of the object is output; no
   values are stored for earlier frames.

   |TO_image0|  This value is useful if you want to plot a histogram of the
   object lifetimes; all but the final age can be ignored or filtered out.

The following object measurements are specific to the LAP
tracking method:

-  *LinkType:* The linking method used to link the object to its parent.
   Possible values are

   -  **0**: The object was not linked to a parent.
   -  **1**: The object was linked to a parent in the
      previous frame.
   -  **2**: The object is linked as the start of a split
      path.
   -  **3**: The object was linked to its parent as a
      daughter of a mitotic pair.
   -  **4**: The object was linked to a parent in a frame
      prior to the previous frame (a gap).

   Under some circumstances, multiple linking methods may apply to a
   given object, e.g, an object may be both the beginning of a split
   path and not have a parent. However, only one linking method is
   assigned.
-  *MovementModel:* The movement model used to track the object.

   -  **0**: The *Random* model was used.
   -  **1**: The *Velocity* model was used.
   -  **-1**: Neither model was used. This can occur under two
      circumstances:

      -  At the beginning of a trajectory, when there is no data to
         determine the model as yet.
      -  At the beginning of a closed gap, since a model was not
         actually applied to make the link in the first phase.

-  *LinkingDistance:* The difference between the propagated position of
   an object and the object to which it is matched.

   |TO_image1| A slowly decaying histogram of these distances indicates
   that the search radius is large enough. A cut-off histogram is a sign
   that the search radius is too small.

-  *StandardDeviation:* The Kalman filter maintains a running estimate
   of the variance of the error in estimated position for each model.
   This measurement records the linking distance divided by the standard
   deviation of the error when linking the object with its parent.

   |TO_image2| This value is multiplied by the
   "*Number of standard deviations for search radius*" setting to constrain the search
   distance. A histogram of this value can help determine if the
   "*Search radius limit, in pixel units (Min,Max)*" setting is appropriate.

-  *GapLength:* The number of frames between an object and its parent.
   For instance, an object in frame 3 with a parent in frame 1 has a gap
   length of 2.
-  *GapScore:* If an object is linked to its parent by bridging a gap,
   this value is the score for the gap.
-  *SplitScore:* If an object linked to its parent via a split, this
   value is the score for the split.
-  *MergeScore:* If an object linked to a child via a merge, this value
   is the score for the merge.
-  *MitosisScore:* If an object linked to two children via a mitosis,
   this value is the score for the mitosis.

**Image measurements**

-  *LostObjectCount:* Number of objects that appear in the previous
   frame but have no identifiable child in the current frame.
-  *NewObjectCount:* Number of objects that appear in the current frame
   but have no identifiable parent in the previous frame.
-  *SplitObjectCount:* Number of objects in the current frame that
   resulted from a split from a parent object in the previous frame.
-  *MergedObjectCount:* Number of objects in the current frame that
   resulted from the merging of child objects in the previous frame.

When trying to track an object in an image, **TrackObjects** will search
within a maximum specified distance (see the *distance within which to
search* setting) of the object's location in the previous image, looking
for a "match". Objects that match are assigned the same number, or
label, throughout the entire movie. There are several options for the
method used to find a match. Choose among these options based on which
is most consistent from frame to frame of your movie.

-  *Overlap:* Compares the amount of spatial overlap between identified
   objects in the previous frame with those in the current frame. The
   object with the greatest amount of spatial overlap will be assigned
   the same number (label).

   |image0| Recommended when there is a high degree of overlap of an
   object from one frame to the next, which is the case for movies with
   high frame rates relative to object motion.

-  *Distance:* Compares the distance between each identified object in
   the previous frame with that of the current frame. The closest
   objects to each other will be assigned the same number (label).
   Distances are measured from the perimeter of each object.

   |image1| Recommended for cases where the objects are not very
   crowded but where *Overlap* does not work sufficiently well, which is
   the case for movies with low frame rates relative to object motion.

-  *Measurements:* Compares each object in the current frame with
   objects in the previous frame based on a particular feature you have
   measured for the objects (for example, a particular intensity or
   shape measurement that can distinguish nearby objects). The object
   with the closest-matching measurement will be selected as a match and
   will be assigned the same number (label). This selection requires
   that you run the specified **Measure** module previous to this module
   in the pipeline so that the measurement values can be used to track
   the objects.
-  *Follow Neighbors:* Uses the multiobject tracking approach described
   by *Delgado-Gonzalo et al., 2010*. This approach assumes objects move
   in a coordinated way (contrary to LAP). An object's movement
   direction is more likely to be in agreement with the movement
   directions of its "neighbors". The problem is formulated as an
   optimization problem and solved using LAP algorithm (same as in LAP
   method).

   |image2| Recommended for cases where the objects are moving in
   synchronized way. In this case it may work better than *LAP*. This
   approach works well for yeast colonies grown on agar.

-  *LAP:* Uses the linear assignment problem (LAP) framework. The linear
   assignment problem (LAP) algorithm (*Jaqaman et al., 2008*) addresses
   the challenges of high object density, motion heterogeneity,
   temporary disappearances, and object merging and splitting. The
   algorithm first links objects between consecutive frames and then
   links the resulting partial trajectories into complete trajectories.
   Both steps are formulated as global combinatorial optimization
   problems whose solution identifies the overall most likely set of
   object trajectories throughout a movie.

   Tracks are constructed from an image sequence by detecting objects in
   each frame and linking objects between consecutive frames as a first
   step. This step alone may result in incompletely tracked objects due
   to the appearance and disappearance of objects, either in reality or
   apparently because of noise and imaging limitations. To correct this,
   you may apply an optional second step which closes temporal gaps
   between tracked objects and captures merging and splitting events.
   This step takes place at the end of the analysis run.

   |image3| Some recommendations on optimizing the LAP settings

   -  *Work with a minimal subset of your data:* Attempting to optimize
      these settings by examining a dataset containing many objects may
      be complicated and frustrating. Therefore, it is a good idea to
      work with a smaller portion of the data containing the behavior of
      interest.

      -  For example, if splits characterize your data, trying narrowing
         down to following just one cell that undergoes a split and
         examine a few frames before and after the event.
      -  You can insert the **Crop** module to zoom in a region of
         interest, optimize the settings and then either remove or
         disable the module when done.
      -  You can also use the **Input** modules to limit yourself to a
         few frames under consideration. For example, use the filtering
         settings in the **Images** module to use only certain files
         from the movie in the pipeline.

   -  *Begin by optimzing the settings for the first phase of the LAP:*
      The 2nd phase of the LAP method depends on the results of the
      first phase. Therefore, it is a good idea to optimize the first
      phase settings as the initial step.

      -  You can disable 2nd phase calculation by selecting *%(NO)s* for
         "Run the second phase of the LAP algorithm?"
      -  By maximizing the number of correct frame-to-frame links in the
         first phase, the 2nd phase will have less candidates to
         consider for linking and have a better chance of closing gaps
         correctly.
      -  If tracks are not being linked in the first phase, you may need
         to adjust the number of standard deviations for the search
         radius and/or the radius limits (most likely the maximum
         limit). See the help for these settings for details.

   -  *Use any visualization tools at your disposal:* Visualizing the
      data often allows for easier decision making as opposed to sorting
      through tabular data alone.

      -  The `R <http://cran.r-project.org/>`__ open-source software
         package has analysis and visualization tools that can query a
         database.
      -  `CellProfiler Tracer <http://cellprofiler.org/tracer/>`__ is a
         version of CellProfiler Analyst that contains tools for
         visualizing time-lapse data that has been exported using the
         **ExportToDatabase** module.

   This Nearest Neighborhood method of this module was prepared by Filip
   Mroz, Adam Kaczmarek and Szymon Stoma. Please reach us at `Scopem,

   a Gaussian distribution.

   |image1| Use this model if the objects move along a spatial

*(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied)*

**TrackObjects** derives a search radius from an error estimation
based on (a) the standard deviation of the movement and (b) the
diameter of the object. Potentially, the module can make an erroneous
assignment with a large error, leading to a large estimated error for
the object in the next frame. Conversely, the module can arrive at a
small estimated error by chance, leading to a maximum radius that does
not track the object in a subsequent frame. The radius limit
constrains the search radius to reasonable values.

|image0| Recommendations:

-  Special care must be taken to adjust the upper limit appropriate to
   the data.
-  The lower limit should be set to a radius (in pixels) that is a
   reasonable displacement for any object from one frame to the next.

   -  If you notice that a frame-to-frame linkage is not being made for
      a steadily-moving object, it may be that this value needs to be
      *decreased* such that the displacement falls above the lower
      limit.
   -  Alternately, if you notice that a frame-to-frame linkage is not
      being made for a roughly stationary object, this value may need to
      be *increased* so that the small displacement error is offset by
      the object diameter.

-  The upper limit should be set to the maximum reasonable displacement

Since object tracks may start and end not only because of the true

*(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied and the second phase is run)*

This setting assigns a cost to keeping a gap caused when an object is
missing from one of the frames of a track (the alternative to keeping
the gap is to bridge it by connecting the tracks on either side of the
missing frames). The cost of bridging a gap is the distance, in
pixels, of the displacement of the object between frames.

|image0|  Recommendations:

-  Set the gap closing cost higher if tracks from objects in previous
   frames are being erroneously joined, across a gap, to tracks from
   objects in subsequent frames.
-  Set the gap closing cost lower if tracks are not properly joined due
   to gaps caused by mis-segmentation.

*(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied and the second phase is run)*

This setting is the cost of keeping two tracks distinct when the
alternative is to make them into one track that splits. A split occurs
when an object in one frame is assigned to the same track as two
objects in a subsequent frame. The split cost takes two components
into account:

-  The area of the split object relative to the area of the resulting
   objects.
-  The displacement of the resulting objects relative to the position of
   the original object.

The split cost is roughly measured in pixels. The split alternative cost
is (conceptually) subtracted from the cost of making the split.

|image0|  Recommendations:

-  The split cost should be set lower if objects are being split that
   should not be split.
-  The split cost should be set higher if objects that should be split
   are not.
-  If you are confident that there should be no splits present in the
   data, the cost can be set to 1 (the minimum value possible)

*(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied and the second phase is run)*

This setting is the cost of keeping two tracks distinct when the
alternative is to merge them into one. A merge occurs when two objects
in one frame are assigned to the same track as a single object in a
subsequent frame. The merge score takes two components into account:

-  The area of the two objects to be merged relative to the area of the
   resulting objects.
-  The displacement of the original objects relative to the final
   object.

The merge cost is measured in pixels. The merge alternative cost is
(conceptually) subtracted from the cost of making the merge.

|image0|  Recommendations:

-  Set the merge alternative cost lower if objects are being merged when
   they should otherwise be kept separate.
-  Set the merge alternative cost higher if objects that are not merged
   should be merged.

*(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied and the second phase is run)*

This setting is the cost of not linking a parent and two daughters via
the mitosis model. the LAP tracking method weighs this cost against
the score of a potential mitosis. The model expects the daughters to
be equidistant from the parent after mitosis, so the parent location
is expected to be midway between the daughters. In addition, the model
expects the daughters’ areas to be equal to the parent’s area. The
mitosis score is the distance error of the parent times the area
inequality ratio of the parent and daughters (the larger of
Area(daughters) / Area(parent) and Area(parent) / Area(daughters)).

|image0|  Recommendations:

-  An accepted mitosis closes two gaps, so all things being equal, the
   mitosis alternative cost should be approximately double the gap
   closing cost.
-  Increase the mitosis alternative cost to favor more mitoses and
   decrease it to prevent more mitoses candidates from being accepted.

This setting acts as a filter for unreasonably large displacements
during the second phase.

|image0|  Recommendations:

-  The maximum gap displacement should be set to roughly the maximum
   displacement of an object’s center from frame to frame. An object
   that makes large frame-to-frame jumps should have a higher value for
   this setting than one that only moves slightly.
-  Be aware that the LAP algorithm will run more slowly with a higher
   maximum gap displacement value, since the higher this value, the more
   objects that must be compared at each step.
-  Objects that would have been tracked between successive frames for a
   lower maximum displacement may not be tracked if the value is set
   higher.
-  This setting may be the culprit if an object is not tracked
   fame-to-frame despite optimizing the LAP first-pass settings.

This setting controls the maximum number of frames that can be skipped
when merging a temporal gap caused by an unsegmented object. These
gaps occur when an image is mis-segmented and identification fails to
find an object in one or more frames.

|image0|  Recommendations:

-  Set the maximum gap higher in order to have more chance of correctly
   recapturing an object after erroneously losing the original for a few
   frames.
-  Set the maximum gap lower to reduce the chance of erroneously
   connecting to the wrong object after correctly losing the original

        # caps the parent and makes it unavailable as a candidate
        # for a gap closing. In the best case, there is only one
        # mitosis candidate for the left and right child and
        # the left and right child are connected to gap alternatives,
        # but there may be competing splits, gap closings or
        # other mitoses.
        #
        # We take a greedy approach, ordering the mitoses by their
        # scores and fulfilling them. After processing the mitoses,
        # we run LAP again, keeping only the parent nodes of untaken
        # mitoses and child nodes connected to gap alternatives
