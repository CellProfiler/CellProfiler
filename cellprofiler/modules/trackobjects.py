"""<b>Track Objects</b> allows tracking objects throughout sequential 
frames of a series of images, so that from frame to frame
each object maintains a unique identity in the output measurements
<hr>

This module must be placed downstream of a module that identifies objects
(e.g., <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>). <b>TrackObjects</b> will associate each
object with the same object in the frames before and after. This allows the study 
of objects' lineages and the timing and characteristics of dynamic events in 
movies.

Images in CellProfiler are processed 
sequentially by frame (whether loaded as a series of images or a movie file). 
To process a collection of images/movies, you will need to 
group the input using grouping options in <b>LoadImages</b> to make sure 
that each image sequence is
handled individually. See the help in that module, and CellProfiler Help > General Help > Using MetaData in CellProfiler for more information. If you are only processing a single movie in each analysis 
run, you do not need to set up image grouping.


For an example pipeline using TrackObjects, see the CellProfiler <a href="http://www.cellprofiler.org/examples.htm">Examples</a> webpage.

<h4>Available measurements</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Object features</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Label:</i> Each tracked object is assigned a unique identifier (label). 
Results of splits or merges are seen as new objects and assigned a new
label.</li>
<li><i>Parent:</i> The label of the object in the last frame. For a split, each
child object will have the label of the object it split from. For a merge,
the child will have the label of the closest parent.</li>
<li><i>TrajectoryX, TrajectoryY:</i> The direction of motion (in x and y coordinates) of the 
object from the previous frame to the current frame.</li>
<li><i>DistanceTraveled:</i> The distance traveled by the object from the 
previous frame to the current frame (calculated as the magnitude of 
the distance traveled vector).</li>
<li><i>IntegratedDistance:</i> The total distance traveled by the object during
the lifetime of the object.</li>
<li><i>Linearity:</i> A measure of how linear the object trajectity is during the
object lifetime. Calculated as (distance from initial to final 
location)/(integrated object distance). Value is in range of [0,1].</li>
<li><i>Lifetime:</i> The duration (in frames) of the object. The lifetime begins 
at the frame when an object appears and is output as a measurement when
the object disappears. At the final frame of the image set/movie, the 
lifetimes of all remaining objects are output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Image features</i>
<ul>
<li><i>LostObjectCount:</i> Number of objects that appear in the previous frame
but have no identifiable child in the current frame.</li>
<li><i>NewObjectCount:</i> Number of objects that appear in the current frame but
have no identifiable parent in the previous frame. </li>
<li><i>DaughterObjectCount:</i> Number of objects in the current frame that 
resulted from a split from a parent object in the previous frame.</li>
<li><i>MergedObjectCount:</i> Number of objects in the current frame that 
resulted from the merging of child objects in the previous frame.</li>
</ul>

            When trying to track an object in an image, 
            <b>TrackObjects</b> will search within a maximum 
            specified distance (see the <i>distance within which to search</i> setting)
            of the object's location in the previous image, looking for a "match".
            Objects that match are assigned the same number, or label, throughout the 
            entire movie.
            There are several options for the method used to find a match. Choose 
            among these options based on which is most consistent from frame
            to frame of your movie.
            <ul>
            <li><i>Overlap:</i> Compares the amount of spatial overlap between identified objects in 
            the previous frame with those in the current frame. The object with the
            greatest amount of spatial overlap will be assigned the same number (label). Recommended
            when there is a high degree of overlap of an object from one frame to the next, 
            which is the case for movies with high frame rates relative to object motion.</li>

            <li><i>Distance:</i> Compares the distance between each identified
            object in the previous frame with that of the current frame. The 
            closest objects to each other will be assigned the same number (label).
            Distances are measured from the perimeter of each object. Recommended
            for cases where the objects are not very crowded but where <i>Overlap</i> 
            does not work sufficiently well, which is the case
            for movies with low frame rates relative to object motion.</li>

            <li><i>Measurement:</i> Compares each object in the 
            current frame with objects in the previous frame based on a particular 
            feature you have measured for the objects (for example, a particular intensity or shape measurement that can distinguish nearby objects). The object 
            with the closest-matching measurement will be selected as a match and will be 
            assigned the same number (label). This selection requires that you run the 
            specified <b>Measure</b> module previous to this module in the pipeline so
            that the measurement values can be used to track the objects.</li>
            
            <li><i>LAP:</i> Uses the linear assignment problem (LAP) framework. The
            linear assignment problem (LAP) algorithm (<i>Jaqaman et al., 2008</i>) 
            addresses the challenges of high object density, motion heterogeneity, 
            temporary disappearances, and object merging and splitting. 
            The algorithm first links objects between consecutive frames and then links 
            the resulting partial trajectories into complete trajectories. Both steps are formulated 
            as global combinatorial optimization problems whose solution identifies the overall 
            most likely set of object trajectories throughout a movie.

            Tracks are constructed from an image sequence by detecting objects in each 
            frame and linking objects between consecutive frames as a first step. This step alone
            may result in incompletely tracked objects due to the appearance and disappearance
            of objects, either in reality or apparently because of noise and imaging limitations.
            To correct this, you may apply an optional second step which closes temporal gaps 
            between tracked objects and captures merging and splitting events. This step takes
            place at the end of the analysis run.  Reference:
