    """Represents a segmentation of an image.

    IdentityPrimAutomatic produces three variants of its segmentation
    result. This object contains all three.

    There are three formats for segmentation, two of which support
    overlapping objects:

    get/set_segmented - legacy, a single plane of labels that does not
                        support overlapping objects
    get/set_labels - supports overlapping objects, returns one or more planes
                     along with indices. A typical usage is to perform an
                     operation per-plane as if the objects did not overlap.
    get/set_ijv    - supports overlapping objects, returns a sparse
                     representation in which the first two columns are the
                     coordinates and the last is the object number. This
                     is efficient for doing things like calculating intensity
                     per-object.

    You can set one of the types and then get any of the types (except that
    get_segmented will raise an exception if objects overlap).
