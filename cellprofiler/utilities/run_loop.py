'''run_loop.py - support for running the OS/X event loop

OS/X needs to run an event loop on the main thread in order to run a user
interface. This is handled by WX when running in 32-bit mode, but needs to
be done explicitly in 64-bit mode if Java loads AWT (e.g. ImageJ 1.0 or
badly-written ImageJ 2.0 plugin).

The run loop stalls the main thread on other platforms without doing anything
else.
