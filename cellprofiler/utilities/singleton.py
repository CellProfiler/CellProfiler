'''
A Python Singleton mixin class that makes use of some of the ideas
found at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonSingleton. Just inherit
from it and you have a singleton. No code is required in
subclasses to create singleton behavior -- inheritance from 
Singleton is all that is needed.

Assume S is a class that inherits from Singleton. Useful behaviors
are:

1) Getting the singleton:

    S.getInstance() 
    
returns the instance of S. If none exists, it is created. 

2) The usual idiom to construct an instance by calling the class, i.e.

    S()
    
is disabled for the sake of clarity. If it were allowed, a programmer
who didn't happen  notice the inheritance from Singleton might think he
was creating a new instance. So it is felt that it is better to
make that clearer by requiring the call of a class method that is defined in
Singleton. An attempt to instantiate via S() will restult in an SingletonException
being raised.

3) If S.__init__(.) requires parameters, include them in the
first call to S.getInstance(.). If subsequent calls have parameters,
a SingletonException is raised.

4) As an implementation detail, classes that inherit 
from Singleton may not have their own __new__
methods. To make sure this requirement is followed, 
an exception is raised if a Singleton subclass includ
es __new__. This happens at subclass instantiation
time (by means of the MetaSingleton metaclass.

placed in the public domain -- which is only reasonable considering
how much it owes to other people's version which are in the
public domain. The idea of using a metaclass came from 
a  comment on Gary's blog (see 
http://www.garyrobinson.net/2004/03/python_singleto.html#comments). 
Other improvements came from comments and email from other
people who saw it online. (See the blog post and comments
