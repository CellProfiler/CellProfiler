## Use

Use the Makefile to create an [Apple Disk Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Disk_Image) (CellProfiler.dmg) that contains the MacOS [package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_(macOS)) (CellProfiler.app), making sure to specify the version via environment variable `CP_VERSION`:

```sh
# replace 4.2.6 with desired version
make CP_VERSION="4.2.6"
```

Among other things, the Makefile construct the file `Info.plist` from `Info.plist.template`. The `Info.plist.template` file contains the version number in double curly braces, `{{CP_VERSION}}`, which in `Info.plist` is replaced by the actual version you specify above.
