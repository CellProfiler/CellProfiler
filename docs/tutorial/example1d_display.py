        # numbers, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries and
        # numpy arrays.
        #
        # It might not be apparent why we require two separate routines, "run"
        # and "display". In test mode, "display" is run in the same thread,
        # immediately after "run". However, in the first released versions,
        # "run" is run in a background thread in analysis mode and "display"
        # is run in the UI thread. This keeps the UI active during analysis,
        # but it means that "display" could happen at any time after "run",
        # including during the next cycle. That means that you have to
        # put the data needed for display some place that won't change.
        # The situation is even more severe in the multiprocessing scenario
        # where "run" is executed in a worker process and "display" is executed
        # in the user interface process.
