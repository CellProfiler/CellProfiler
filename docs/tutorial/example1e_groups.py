'''<b>Example1e</b> demonstrates SettingsGroup
<hr>
There are many circumstances where it would be useful to let a user specify
an arbitrary number of a group of settings. For instance, you might want to
sum an arbitrary number of images together in your module or perform the
same operation on every listed image or object. This is done using
cps.SettingsGroup and by overriding the prepare_settings method.

    # to be run in the user interface thread (CellProfiler would crash under
    # OS-X otherwise).
