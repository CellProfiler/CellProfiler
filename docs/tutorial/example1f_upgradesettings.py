# In Example 1f, we add a new setting to an existing module and make the new
# version capable of loading a pipeline containing the old version.
# 
# We've taken quite a bit of care to ensure that old, even CellProfiler 1.0,
# pipelines can be loaded by every subsequent version, in almost all cases
# without any modification. The key to this process is the 
# variable_revision_number. We change the variable_revision_number for the
# module whenever we make a change to how the pipeline might be saved.
# This happens when a setting is added or changed to a different type or when
# the choice text for a choice setting changes (in some cases, we've added
# code to handle both the old and new text without changing the revision).
#
# Here, variable_revision_number 2 of the module lets the user specify
# the sigma for the Gaussian and, in version 1, someone had misspelled
# "Gaussian" as "Gassian". The exercise is to add the new sigma setting
# and construct the method, "upgrade_settings", which is responsible
# for converting the settings of a version 1 module to a version 2 module.
