'''<b>Example2a</b> - An example of an image processing function.
<hr>
This example deconvolves the image with a Gaussian. Given a point spread
function that is an accurate representation of how optics aberations map
a point to pixels in an image, the deconvolution with that point spread
function uses the information in the blurred image to reconstruct the
true intensity.

Here, we implement the Richardson/Lucy algorithm. The choice of a Gaussian
as the point-spread function is an arbitrary one; in reality, a PSF could
be determined from an image with true point sources, such as a well-localized
fluorophore.
