# cellprofiler.cpmath.cpmorphology has many useful image processing algorithms.
# 
# skeletonize_labels performs the skeletonization (medial axis transform) for
# each labeled object in a labels matrix. It can skeletonize thousands of
# objects in an image almost as rapidly as skeletonizing a single object
# of the same complexity.
