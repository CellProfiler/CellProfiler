        # It's just a little expensive finding out which labels are
        # touching others. The trick here is to use a function from
        # cpmorphology called "color_labels". This is akin to the
        # four color theorem - you want to color objects so that no
        # two adjacent ones have the same color.
        #
        # After we've done that, we process each of the colors in turn,
        # knowing that each object is colored only once and none of its
        # neighbors have the same color.
        #
        # This is a good demo of why Python and Numpy are good choices
        # for image processing. We're handling some pretty abstract
        # concepts in just a few lines of code and the result, I hope,
        # is clear and readable.
        #
        from cellprofiler.cpmath.cpmorphology import color_labels
        #
        # First, reserve a vector that we'll use within the loop to store
        # the measurement values. I cheat a little here in order to use
        # object indexing. 0 is the background and values[0] will never
        # be written. values[object_number] will be the measurement for
        # that object number. Consequently, we need an extra slot in the
        # vector because we are indexing by 1.
        #
        ##values = np.zeros(objects.count+1)
        #
        # Each outer loop iteration gets a labels matrix and the object numbers
        # represented within the labels matrix. If there are no overlaps,
        # there will only be one iteration.
        # 
        ##for labels, indices in objects.get_labels():
            #
            # Now we use color_labels to magically produce an array in which
            # all the background pixels have the value, "0", and the pixels
            # of touching objects have different numbers
            #
            ##clabels = color_labels(labels)
            #
            # np.unique returns the unique #s in an array.
            #
            ##colors = np.unique(clabels)
            ##for color in colors:
                # 0 = background, so ignore it.
                ##if color == 0:
                ##    continue
                #
                # Ok, here's a trick. clabels == color gets converted
                # to either 1 (is the current color) or 0 (is not) and
                # we can use that to mask only the labels for the current
                # color by multiplying (0 * anything = 0)
                #
                ##foreground = clabels == color
                ##mini_labels = labels * foreground
                ##distance = scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt(foreground)
                #
                # And here's another trick - scipy.ndimage.mean returns
                # NaN for any index that doesn't appear because the
                # mean isn't computable. How lucky!
