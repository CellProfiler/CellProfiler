"""Propagate from a set of seed values

This module takes an image and a set of seed labels and assigns a label to
each pixel based on which label is closest to a pixel. Distances are
cumulative: given a path through pixels 1 to N, the distance to pixel N is
the distance from 1 to 2 plus the distance from 2 to 3 and so on. The distance
metric is the following:

given pixels at i1,j1 and i2,j2

height_diff = sum of height differences between nine neighbors of i1,j1 and
              nine neighbors of i2,j2

manhattan_distance = abs(i2-i1)+abs(j2-j1)

distance = sqrt(height_diff**2 + manhattan_distance * weight**2)

where "weight" is an input that weights the importance of image versus
pixel distance.

The priority queue operates using integer values. Doubles can be ordered
lexicographically by their bits - this means that the following
equation converts a double to two ints  that preserve order when 
lexicographically compared:

double x
int *pix = <int *>&x
if big_endian:
    i1 = pix[0]
    i2 = pix[1]-2147483648 # to make -1 into 0x7FFFFFFF
else:
    i1 = pix[1]
    i2 = pix[0]-2147483648
