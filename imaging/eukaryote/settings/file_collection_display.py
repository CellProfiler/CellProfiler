class FileCollectionDisplay(Setting):
    '''A setting to be used to display directories and their files

    The FileCollectionDisplay shows directory trees with mechanisms to
    communicate directory additions and deletions to its parent module.

    The central data structure is the dictionary, "self.file_tree". The keys
    for the top-level of the dictionary are the directories managed by the
    setting. If a key represents a directory, its value is another directory.
    If a key represents a file, its value is either True (the file is included
    in the collection) or False (the file is filtered out of the collection).

    Directory dictionaries can be filtered: this is done by setting the
    special key, "None" to either True or False.

    The FileCollectionDisplay manages the tree and it should be treated as
    read-only by callers. Callers can request that nodes be added, removed,
    filtered or not filtered by calling the appropriate notification function
    with a nested collection of two-tuples and strings (modpaths). Two-tuples
    represent directories whose subdirectories or files are being operated on.
    Strings represent directories or files that are being operated on. The first
    element of the two-tuple is the directory name and the second is a
    sub-collection of two-tuples. For instance, to operate on foo/bar, send:

    ("foo", ("bar", ))

    The FileCollectionDisplay communicates events on individual files or
    directories by specifying a path as a collection of path parts. These
    can be any sort of object and it is the caller's job to maintain the
    display names of each of them and their node categories (used for
    icon display).

        fn_on_drop - called when files are dropped. The signature is
                     fn_on_drop(pathnames, check_for_directories) The first
                     argument is a list of pathnames of the dropped files.
                     The second argument is True if the user has performed
                     a file name drop which might include directories and
                     False if the user has dropped text file names.

        fn_on_remove - called when the UI requests that files be removed. Has
                       one argument which is a collection of paths to remove.

        fn_get_path_info - called when the UI needs to know the display name,
                     icon type, context menu and tool tip for an item. These
                     are returned in a four-tuple by the callee, e.g:

                       ( "Show image", "Show metadata", "Delete image")]

        fn_on_menu_command - called when the user selects a context menu
                     command. The argument is the text from the context menu or
                     None if the default command.

        fn_on_bkgnd_control - called when the UI wants to stop, pause or resume
                     all background processing. BKGND_PAUSE asks for the
                     caller to pause processing, BKGND_RESUME asks for the
                     caller to resume, BKGND_STOP asks for processing to be
                     aborted, BKGND_GET_STATE asks for the caller to
                     return its current state = BKGND_PAUSE if it is paused,
                     BKGND_RESUME if it is running or BKGND_STOP if it is
                     idle.
