    '''The joiner setting defines a joining condition between conceptual tables

    You might want to join several tables by specifying the columns that match
    each other or might want to join images in an image set by matching
    their metadata. The joiner takes a dictionary of lists of column names
    or metadata keys where the dictionary key holds the table or image name
    and the list of values holds the names of table columns or metadata keys.

    The joiner's value is, conceptually, a list of dictionaries where each
    dictionary in the list documents how to join one column or metadata key
    in one of the tables or images to the others.

    The conceptual value is a list of dictionaries of unicode string keys
    and values (or value = None). This can be encoded using str() and
    can be decoded using eval.
