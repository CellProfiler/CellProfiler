'''<b>Measure Correlation</b> measures the correlation between intensities in different images (e.g.,
different color channels) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, within identified
objects or across an entire image.
<hr>
Given two or more images, this module calculates the correlation between the
pixel intensities. The correlation can be measured for entire
images, or a correlation measurement can be made within each
individual object.

Correlations will be calculated between all pairs of images that are selected in 
the module, as well as between selected objects. For example, if correlations 
are to be measured for a set of red, green, and blue images containing identified nuclei, 
measurements will be made between the following:
<ul>
<li>The blue and green, red and green, and red and blue images. </li>
<li>The nuclei in each of the above image pairs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Available measurements</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Correlation:</i> The correlation between a pair of images <i>I</i> and <i>J</i>, 
calculated as Pearson's correlation coefficient. The formula is
covariance(<i>I</i> ,<i>J</i>)/[std(<i>I</i> ) &times; std(<i>J</i>)].</li>
<li><i>Slope:</i> The slope of the least-squares regression between a pair of images
I and J. Calculated using the model <i>A</i> &times; <i>I</i> + <i>B</i> = <i>J</i>, w
here <i>A</i> is the slope.</li>
</ul>
