MergeObjects
===========

**MergeObjects** merges objects below a certain threshold into its most prevalent, adjacent neighbor.

The output of this module is a object image of the same data type as the input.
**MergeObjects** can be run *after* any labeling or segmentation module (e.g.,
**ConvertImageToObjects** or **Watershed**). Labels are preserved and, where possible, small
objects are merged into neighboring objects that constitute a majority of the small object's
border. This is useful for reversing over-segmentation and artifacts that result from seeding
modules.

each slice of a volumetric image, rather than on the

artifacts that are the result of segmentation.
**Note**: Slice-wise operations will be considerably slower.
