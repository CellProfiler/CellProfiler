    Determine the principal components of a vector of measurements
    x should be a M x N numpy array composed of M observations of n variables
    The output is:
    coeffs - the NxN correlation matrix that can be used to transform x into its components
    
    The code for this function is based on "A Tutorial on Principal Component
    Analysis", Shlens, 2005 http://www.snl.salk.edu/~shlens/pub/notes/pca.pdf
