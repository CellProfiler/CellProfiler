<h2 class="title">Exporting results</h2>

<p>Writing the measurements generated by CellProfiler is necessary for
downstream statistical analysis. The most common format for export is the
<i>spreadsheet</i> which is a table of values. The module
<b>ExportToSpreadsheet</b> handles the task of writing the measurements
(for images, objects or both) to a file readable by Excel, or the
spreadsheet program of your choice.</p>

<p>For larger assays, involving tens of thousands of images or more, a
spreadsheet is usually insufficient to handle the massive amounts of data
generated. A <i>database</i> is a better solution in this case, although
this requires more computational expertise; the <b>ExportToDatabase</b>
module is to be used for this task. If this avenue is needed, it is best to
consult with your information technology department.</p>

<p>CellProfiler will not save images produce by analysis modules unless
told to do so. It is often desirable to save the outlines of the objects
identified; this can is useful as a sanity check of the object
identification results or for quality control purposes. The
<b>SaveImages</b> module is used for saving images to a variety of output
formats; you can specify the nomenclature.</p>

<p>For more information on these modules and how to configure them for best
performance, please see the detailed help by selecting the module and
clicking the <img src="{{MODULE_HELP_BUTTON}}"> button at the bottom
of the pipeline panel. You can also find details on various exporting
options under <i>Help > Using Your Output</i></p>
