MATLAB Format Images
====================

Previous versions of CellProfiler supported reading and writing of MATLAB
format (.mat) images. MATLAB format images were useful for exporting
illumination correction functions generated by **CorrectIlluminationCalculate**.
These images could be loaded and applied to other pipelines using
**CorrectIlluminationApply**.

This version of CellProfiler no longer supports reading or exporting 
MATLAB format images. Instead, the recommended image format for illumination 
correction functions is NumPy (.npy). Loading MATLAB format images can only be
done in CellProfiler versions through 3.1.9. To ensure compatibility with future 
versions of CellProfiler you can convert your .mat files to .npy
files via **SaveImages** using any 3.X build of CellProfiler.

See **SaveImages** for more details on saving NumPy format images.
