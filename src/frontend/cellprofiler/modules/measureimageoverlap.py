MeasureImageOverlap
===================

**MeasureImageOverlap** calculates how much overlap occurs between
the white portions of two black and white images

This module calculates overlap by determining a set of statistics that
measure the closeness of an image to its true value. One
image is considered the “ground truth” (possibly the result of
hand-segmentation) and the other is the “test” image; the images
are determined to overlap most completely when the test image matches
the ground truth perfectly. The module requires binary
(black and white) input, where the foreground of the images is white and the
background is black. If you segment your images in CellProfiler using
**IdentifyPrimaryObjects**, you can create such an image using
**ConvertObjectsToImage** by selecting *Binary* as the color type. If
your images have been segmented using other image processing software,
or you have hand-segmented them in software such as Photoshop, you may
need to use one or more of the following to prepare the images for this
module:

-  **ImageMath**: If the objects are black and the background is white,
   you must invert the intensity using this module.

-  **Threshold**: If the image is grayscale, you must make it
   binary using this module, or alternately use an **Identify** module
   followed by **ConvertObjectsToImage** as described above.

-  **ColorToGray**: If the image is in color, you must first convert it
   to grayscale using this module, and then use **Threshold** to
   generate a binary image.

In the test image, any foreground (white) pixels that overlap with the
foreground of the ground truth will be considered “true positives”,
since they are correctly labeled as foreground. Background (black)
pixels that overlap with the background of the ground truth image are
considered “true negatives”, since they are correctly labeled as
background. A foreground pixel in the test image that overlaps with the
background in the ground truth image will be considered a “false
positive” (since it should have been labeled as part of the background),
while a background pixel in the test image that overlaps with foreground
in the ground truth will be considered a “false negative” (since it was
labeled as part of the background, but should not be).

For 3D images, all image planes are concatenated into one large XY image and 
the overlap is computed on the transformed image.

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *True positive rate:* Total number of true positive pixels / total number of actual positive pixels.

-  *False positive rate:* Total number of false positive pixels / total number of actual negative pixels.

-  *True negative rate:* Total number of true negative pixels / total number of actual negative pixels.

-  *False negative rate:* Total number of false negative pixels / total number of actual positive pixels.

-  *Precision:* Number of true positive pixels / (number of true positive pixels + number of false positive pixels).

-  *Recall:* Number of true positive pixels/ (number of true positive pixels + number of false negative pixels).

-  *F-factor:* 2 × (precision × recall)/(precision + recall). Also known as F\ :sub:`1` score, F-score or F-measure.

-  *Earth mover’s distance:* The minimum distance required to move each foreground pixel in the test image to
   some corresponding foreground pixel in the reference image.

-  *Rand index:* A measure of the similarity between two data clusterings. Perfectly random clustering
   returns the minimum score of 0, perfect clustering returns the maximum score of 1.

-  *Adjusted Rand index:* A variation of the Rand index which considers a correction for chance.

penalty for the discrepancy when comparing the accuracy of a
segmentation because the discrepancy represents an error. It’s also
reasonable to assess no penalty if the goal is to compute the cost of
movement, for example between two frames in a time-lapse movie, because
the discrepancy is likely caused by noise or artifacts in segmentation.
