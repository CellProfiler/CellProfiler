"""analysis_worker.py - Run pipelines on imagesets to produce measurements.

The analysis worker listens on a ZMQ port for work announcements. It then
requests jobs from the announcer and executes them. As an application,
the analysis worker runs three threads:

* Main thread - spawns the worker and monitor threads and enters a run loop.
                The run loop is needed on OS/X in order to process the UI.
                The UI is needed by ImageJ 1.0 which starts AWT. The main thread
                issues a stop notification to the worker thread after exiting
                the run loop.

* Worker thread - listens for jobs and processes them until it receives a stop
                  notification from the main thread.

* Monitor thread - reads from STDIN. If the parent process closes STDIN,
                   the read call throws an exception and the monitor thread
                   stops the main thread's run loop.
