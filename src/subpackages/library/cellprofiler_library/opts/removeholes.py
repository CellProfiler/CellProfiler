"""
Options and enums for RemoveHoles module
"""

# Note: RemoveHoles is a simple morphological operation module that doesn't require
# complex enums. The main configuration is handled through the diameter setting
# which is managed by the core framework.

# Currently no custom enums needed for RemoveHoles as it uses standard
# Diameter setting from cellprofiler_core
