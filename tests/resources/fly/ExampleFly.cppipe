MessageForUser:|Now that you have loaded a pipeline, you will need to provide CellProfiler with images to analyze.\n\nDrag the folder containing the example images (downloaded to the same location on your computer\nas the pipeline) into the Images module, placing them into the File list panel labelled "Drop files and\nfolders here". Or, right-click in the File list panel to browse for the individual files to process.\n\nThen, press the "Analyze Images" button to process the images so you can see how the pipeline works.
