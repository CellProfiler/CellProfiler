 - SaveImages can now automatically number images when there are more then 100 cycles
 - Several various bug fixes

Version 1.0.4303
 - Added MeasureImageSlope and Combine modules

Version 1.0.3775
 - Windows menu now shows all CellProfiler windows
 - Added module MaskImage
 - Changed smoothing method to use gaussian filter instead of binary
 - MeasureTexture uses ScaleOfTexture for objects
 - MeasureObjectNeighbors records closest 2 objects and their vectors and percent of neighbors touching each object
 - ExportToDatabase creates MySQL tables with FLOAT NOT NULL to improve speed
 - ExportData can export labels created by ClassifyObjects
 - Added help menu for Modules
 - Several various bug fixes

Version 1.0.3544
 - Added new help section "Getting Started"
 - Added help on Batch Processing
 - CreateBatchScripts is now CreateBatchFiles
 - CreateBatchFiles can produce files for CPCluster, which allows users to do cluster analysis without MatLab licenses
 - WriteSQLFiles is now ExportToDatabase
 - ExportToDatabase can export SQL files for MySQL and Oracle
 - ShowDataOnImage can now show text labels added with LoadText or AddData
 - ClassifyObjects can now label bins, which can be seen with ShowDataOnImage

Version 1.0.3443
 - Added meander mode for tiling images
 - Rotate correctly states that a positive angle gives counterclockwise rotation
 - MergeBatchOutput now looks in Default Output Folder

Version 1.0.4818
 - Smoothing has been updated. Previously, 'median filtering' was really 'Gaussian filtering.'  We have added Gaussian Filtering and fixed Median Filtering.  To achieve similar results, you will need to use the 'Gaussian Filter' setting.  Modules where you may notice this change: CorrectIllumination_Calculate, CPSmooth, IdentifyPrimAutomatic, and FindEdges.
 - CPSmooth speed optimization.
